<h2 id="PREFACE1">PREFATORY NOTICE.</h2>

<p>The present work by Professor Weismann, well
known for his profound embryological investigations
on the Diptera, will appear, I believe, to every
naturalist extremely interesting and well deserving
of careful study. Any one looking at the longitudinal
and oblique stripes, often of various and
bright colours, on the caterpillars of Sphinx-moths,
would naturally be inclined to doubt
whether these could be of the least use to the
insect; in the olden time they would have been
called freaks of Nature. But the present book
shows that in most cases the colouring can hardly
fail to be of high importance as a protection.
This indeed was proved experimentally in one of
the most curious instances described, in which
the thickened anterior end of the caterpillar bears
two large ocelli or eye-like spots, which give to
the creature so formidable an appearance that
birds were frightened away. But the mere explanation
of the colouring of these caterpillars is
but a very small part of the merit of the work.
This mainly consists in the light thrown on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
laws of variation and of inheritance by the facts
given and discussed. There is also a valuable discussion
on classification, as founded on characters
displayed at different ages by animals belonging
to the same group. Several distinguished naturalists
maintain with much confidence that organic
beings tend to vary and to rise in the scale, independently
of the conditions to which they and
their progenitors have been exposed; whilst
others maintain that all variation is due to such
exposure, though the manner in which the environment
acts is as yet quite unknown. At the
present time there is hardly any question in
biology of more importance than this of the
nature and causes of variability, and the reader
will find in the present work an able discussion
on the whole subject, which will probably lead
him to pause before he admits the existence of an
innate tendency to perfectibility. Finally, whoever
compares the discussions in this volume with
those published twenty years ago on any branch
of Natural History, will see how wide and rich a
field for study has been opened up through the
principle of Evolution; and such fields, without the
light shed on them by this principle, would for
long or for ever have remained barren.</p>

<h2 id="PREFACE2">TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.</h2>

<p>In offering to English readers this translation of
Professor Weismann’s well-known “Studies in the
Theory of Descent,” the main part of which is
devoted to entomological subjects, I have been
actuated by the desire of placing in the hands of
English naturalists one of the most complete of
recent contributions to the theory of Evolution as
applied to the elucidation of certain interesting
groups of facts offered by the insect world.
Although many, if not most, working naturalists
are already familiar with the results of Dr. Weismann’s
researches, of which abstracts have from
time to time appeared in English and American
scientific journals, I nevertheless believe that a
study of the complete work, by enabling the
reader to follow closely the detailed lines of
reasoning and methods of experiment employed
by the author, will be found to be of considerable
value to those biologists who have not been able
to follow the somewhat difficult phraseology of
the original. It is not my intention, nor would it
be becoming in me to discuss here the merits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
the results arrived at by the minute and laborious
investigations with which Dr. Weismann has for
many years occupied himself. I may however
point out that before the appearance of the
present work the author, in addition to his well-known
papers on the embryology and development
of insects, had published two valuable contributions
to the theory of descent, viz. one
entitled “Über die Berechtigung der Darwin’schen
Theorie” (1868), and another “Über den Einfluss
der Isolirung auf die Artbildung” (1872). These
works, which are perhaps not so well known in
this country as could be desired, might be advantageously
studied in connection with the present
volume wherein they are frequently referred to.</p>

<p>Since every new contribution to science is a
fresh starting-point for future work, I may venture
without any great breach of propriety to dwell
briefly upon one or two of the main points which
appear to me to be suggested by Prof. Weismann’s
investigations.</p>

<p>Although the causes of Glacial Epochs is a
subject which has much occupied the attention of
geologists and physiographers, the question is one
of such great complexity that it cannot yet be
regarded as finally settled. But apart from the
question of causes&mdash;a most able discussion of
which is given by the author of “Island Life”&mdash;there
is not the least doubt that at no very
distant geological period there occurred such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
epoch, which, although intermittent, was of considerable
duration. The last great geological
event which our globe experienced was in fact
this Ice Age, and the pure naturalist has not
hitherto attributed in my opinion sufficient importance
to the <i>direct</i> modifying effects of this
prolonged period of cold. It is scarcely possible
that such a vast climatic change as that which
came on at the close of the Pliocene Period
should have left no permanent effect upon our
present fauna and flora, all the species of which
have survived from the glacial age. The great
principle of Natural Selection leads us to see
how pre-glacial forms may have become adapted
to the new climatic conditions (which came on
gradually) by the “survival of the fittest” or
“indirect equilibration.” The influence of the
last Glacial Epoch as a factor in determining the
present geographical distribution of animals and
plants has already been amply treated of by many
writers since the broad paths were traced out by
Darwin, Lyell, and Wallace. The last-named
author has indeed quite recently discussed this
branch of the subject most exhaustively in his
work on “Island Life” above mentioned. The
reference of a particular group of phenomena&mdash;the
seasonal dimorphism of butterflies&mdash;to the
direct action of the Glacial Period and the subsequent
influence of the ameliorating climate, was
however the first step taken in this neglected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
field by the author of the present work in 1875.
It is possible, and indeed probable, that future
researches will show that other characters among
existing species can be traced to the same causes.</p>

<p>The great generalizations of embryology, which
science owes so largely to the researches of Karl
Ernst von Baer, bear to the theory of descent
the same relations that Kepler’s laws bear to the
theory of gravitation. These last-named laws are
nothing more than generalized statements of the
motions of the planets, which were devoid of
meaning till the enunciation of the theory of
gravitation. Similarly the generalized facts of
embryology are meaningless except in the light
of the theory of descent. It has now become a
recognized principle in biology that animals in
the course of their development from the ovum
recapitulate more or less completely the phases
through which their ancestors have passed. The
practical application of this principle to the
determination of the line of descent of any
species or group of species is surrounded by
difficulties, but attempts have been made of late
years&mdash;as by Haeckel in his <i>Gastrula</i> theory&mdash;to
push the law to its legitimate consequences. In
this country Sir John Lubbock, in 1874, appealed
to the embryonic characters of larvæ in support
of his views on the origin of insects. To the
author of this work (1876) is due the first application
of the principle of Ontogeny as revealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
the origin of the markings of caterpillars. A
most valuable method of research is thus opened
up, and entomologists should not be long in
availing themselves of it. Our knowledge of the
subject of larval development in Lepidoptera
is still most imperfect, and it cannot as yet be
foreseen to what extent the existing notions of
classification in this much-studied order may have
to be modified when a minute study of the Comparative
Ontogeny of larval characters, worked out
as completely as possible for each family, has
enabled a true genealogical system to be drawn
up. The extent to which such a larval genealogy
would coincide with our present classification
cannot now be decided, but he who approaches this
fruitful line of inquiry in the true spirit of an investigator,
will derive much instruction from Prof.
Weismann’s remarks on “Phyletic Parallelism in
Metamorphic Species.” The affinities of the
larger groups among Lepidoptera would most
probably be made out once and for ever if
systematists would devote more time to observation
in this field, and to the co-ordination and
working up of the numerous data scattered
throughout the vast number of entomological
publications.</p>

<p>The doctrine of development by no means
implies, as has sometimes been maintained, a
continuous <i>advancement</i> in organization. Although
the scale of organic nature has continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
to rise as a whole, cases may occasionally occur
where a <i>lower grade</i> of organization is better
adapted to certain conditions of life. This
principle of “degeneration” was recognized by
Darwin as early as in the first edition of the
“Origin of Species;” it was soon perceived to be
applicable to the phenomenon of parasitism, and
was first definitely formulated by Dr. Anton
Dohrn in 1875. In a lecture delivered before the
British Association at Sheffield in 1879, Prof.
E. Ray Lankester ascribed to “degeneration” a
distinct and well-defined function in the theory of
descent. Dr. Weismann’s explanation of the
transformation of Axolotl given in the fourth
essay of this work, may be regarded as a special
contribution to this phase of Darwinism. Whilst
refuting the idea held by certain naturalists, that
such cases are arguments against the origin of
species by the accumulation of minute variations,
and prove the possibility of development <i>per
saltum</i>, the theory here advanced (that <i>Siredon</i>
at a former period existed at a higher stage of
development as <i>Amblystoma</i>, and that the observed
cases of metamorphosis are but reversions to this
lost higher stage) suggests the question whether
there may not still be in existence many other
degenerated forms quite unsuspected by naturalists.</p>

<p>Many of the opponents of Evolution have from
time to time denounced this doctrine as leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>
to “pure materialism,” a denunciation which may
appear somewhat alarming to the uninitiated, but
which may not seem fraught with any serious
consequences to those who have followed the
course of philosophical speculation during the last
few years. Those who attack the doctrine on
this ground will however do well to consider Prof.
Weismann’s views set forth in the last essay
in this volume, before hastily assuming that the
much dreaded “materialism” is incompatible with
any other conception of Nature.</p>

<p>The small amount of leisure time which I have
been able to devote to the translation of this
volume has delayed its completion considerably
beyond the anticipated time, and it was with a
view to meeting this difficulty that I departed
from the original form of the German edition and
issued it in parts. Owing to the extremely
idiomatic character of the German text, I have
throughout endeavoured to preserve only the
author’s meaning, regardless of literal translation
or of the construction of the original. In some
few cases, however, I have intentionally adopted
literal translations of certain technical expressions
which might, I think, be advantageously introduced
into our biological vocabularies. Some
alterations have been made in the original text
by the author for the present edition, and many
new notes have been added. For those bearing
my initials I am alone responsible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span>
It gives me much pleasure in conclusion to
express my thanks to Dr. Weismann, not only for
the readily given permission to publish an English
translation of his work, but also for much valuable
assistance during the execution of the task. The
author has been good enough to superintend the
drawing of the plates for this edition, and he has
also read through the greater part of the manuscript.
From Mr. Darwin also I have received
much kindly encouragement, and among entomologists
I am especially indebted to Mr. W. H.
Edwards of West Virginia, for his valuable additions
to the first part. To my friends Mr. A.
G. Butler, Mr. Roland Trimen, and Mr. F. Moore,
I owe acknowledgments for much useful information
concerning the caterpillars of exotic
<i>Sphingidæ</i>, which I have incorporated in the
notes and appendices, and Mr. W. S. Simpson
has given me occasional advice in the translation
of some of the more difficult passages.</p>

<h2 id="PREFACE3">PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH EDITION.</h2>

<p>With the appearance of Charles Darwin’s work
“On the Origin of Species,” in the year 1858,
there commenced a new era in biology. Weary
of the philosophical speculations which, at the
beginning of this century, had at first been started
with moderation but had afterwards been pushed
to excess, biologists had entirely let drop all
general questions and confined themselves to
special investigations. The consideration even of
general questions had quite fallen into disuse,
and the investigation of mere details had led to a
state of intellectual shortsightedness, interest
being shown only for that which was immediately
in view. Immense numbers of detailed facts were
thus accumulated, but they could not possibly be
mastered; the intellectual bond which should
have bound them together was wanting.</p>

<p>But all this was changed in a short time. At
first only single and mostly the younger naturalists
fell in with the new theory of development proclaimed
by Darwin, but the conviction soon
became general that this was the only scientifically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">xvi</a></span>
justifiable hypothesis of the origin of the
organic world.</p>

<p>The materials accumulated in all the provinces
of biology now for the first time acquired a deeper
meaning and significance; unexpected inter-relations
revealed themselves as though spontaneously,
and what formerly appeared as unanswerable
enigmas now became clear and comprehensible.
Since that time what a vast modification has the
subject of animal embryology undergone; how
full of meaning appear the youngest developmental
stages, how important the larvæ; how
significant are rudimentary organs; what department
of biology has not in some measure become
affected by the modifying influence of the new
ideas!</p>

<p>But the doctrine of development not only
enabled us to understand the facts already
existing; it gave at the same time an impetus to
the acquisition of unforeseen new ones. If at the
present day we glance back at the development
of the biological sciences within the last twenty
years, we must be astonished both at the enormous
array of new facts which have been evoked by the
theory of development, and by the immense series
of special investigations which have been called
forth by this doctrine.</p>

<p>But while the development theory for by far the
greater majority of these investigations served as
a light which more and more illuminated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">xvii</a></span>
darkness of ignorance, there appeared at the same
time some other researches in which this doctrine
itself became the object of investigation, and
which were undertaken with a view to establish it
more securely.</p>

<p>To this latter class of work belong the
“Studies” in the present volume.</p>

<p>It will perhaps be objected that the theory of
descent has already been sufficiently established
by Darwin and Wallace. It is true that their
newly-discovered principle of selection is of the
very greatest importance, since it solves the riddle
as to how that which is useful can arise in a purely
mechanical way. Nor can the transforming influence
of direct action, as upheld by Lamarck, be
called in question, although its extent cannot as yet
be estimated with any certainty. The <i>secondary</i>
modifications which Darwin regards as the consequence
of a change in some other organ must
also be conceded. But are these three factors
actually competent to explain the complete transformation
of one species into another? Can they
transform more than mere single characters or
groups of characters? Can we consider them as
the sole causes of the regular phenomena of the
development of the races of animals and plants?
Is there not perhaps an unknown force underlying
these numberless developmental series as the true
motor power&mdash;a “developmental force” urging
species to vary in certain directions and thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">xviii</a></span>
calling into existence the chief types and sub-types
of the animal and vegetable kingdoms?</p>

<p>At the time these “Studies” first appeared
(1875) they had been preceded by a whole series
of attempts to introduce into science such an unknown
power. The botanists, Nägeli and Askenasy,
had designated it the “perfecting principle” or the
“fixed direction of variation;” Kolliker as the “law
of creation;” the philosophers, Von Hartmann and
Huber, as the “law of organic development,” and
also “the universal principle of organic nature.”</p>

<p>It was thus not entirely superfluous to test the
capabilities of the known factors of transformation.
We had here before us a question of the highest
importance&mdash;a question which entered deeply into
all our general notions, not only of the organic
world, but of the universe as a whole.</p>

<p>This question&mdash;does there exist a special
“developmental force”?&mdash;obviously cannot be
decided by mere speculation; it must also be
attempted to approach it by the inductive
method.</p>

<p>The five essays in this volume are attempts to
arrive, from various sides, somewhat nearer at a
solution of the problem indicated.</p>

<p>The first essay on the “Seasonal Dimorphism
of Butterflies” is certainly but indirectly connected
with the question; it is therein attempted to discover
the causes of this remarkable dimorphism,
and by this means to indicate at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">xix</a></span>
the extent of one of the transforming factors with
reference to a definite case. The experiments
upon which I base my views are not as numerous
as I could desire, and if I were now able to repeat
them they would be carried out more exactly than
was possible at that time, when an experimental
basis had first to be established. In spite of this,
the conclusions to which I was led appear to be
on the whole correct. That admirable and most
conscientious observer of the North American
butterflies, Mr. W. H. Edwards, has for many
years experimented with American species in a
manner similar to that which I employed for
European species, and his results, which are published
here in <a href="#P1-A1">Appendix II</a>. to the first essay,
contain nothing as far as I can see which is not
in harmony with my views. Many new questions
suggest themselves, however, and it would be a
grateful task if some entomologist would go
further into these investigations.</p>

<p>The second essay directly attacks the main
problem above indicated. It treats of the “Origin
of the Markings of Caterpillars,” and is to some
extent a test of the correctness and capabilities of
the Darwinian principles; it attempts to trace the
differences in form in a definite although small
group entirely to known factors.</p>

<p>Why the markings of caterpillars have particularly
been chosen for this purpose will appear for
two reasons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">xx</a></span>
The action of Natural Selection, on account of
the nature of this agency, can only be exerted on
those characters which are of biological importance.
As it was to be tested whether, besides
Natural Selection and the direct action of external
conditions, together with the correlative results of
these two factors, there might not lie concealed
in the organism some other unknown transforming
power, it was desirable to select for the investigation
a group of forms which, if not absolutely
excluding, nevertheless appeared possibly to restrict,
the action of one of the two known factors
of transformation, that of Natural Selection; a
group of forms consisting essentially of so-called
“purely morphological” characters, and not of
those the utility of which was obvious, and of
which the origin by means of Natural Selection
was both possible and probable <i>ab initio</i>. Now,
although the <i>colouring</i> can readily be seen to be
of value to the life of its possessors, this is not
the case with the quite independent <i>markings</i> of
caterpillars; excepting perhaps those occasional
forms of marking which have been regarded as
special cases of protective resemblance. The
markings of caterpillars must in general be considered
as “purely morphological” characters,
<i>i.e.</i> as characters which we do not know to be of
any importance to the life of the species, and
which cannot therefore be referred to Natural
Selection. The most plausible explanation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">xxi</a></span>
these markings might have been that they were
to be regarded as ornaments, but this view precludes
the possibility of referring them either to
Natural Selection or to the influence of direct
changes in the environment.</p>

<p>The markings of caterpillars offered also
another advantage which cannot be lightly
estimated; they precluded from the first any
attempt at an explanation by means of Sexual
Selection. Although I am strongly convinced of
the activity and great importance of this last
process of selection, its effects cannot be estimated
in any particular case, and the origin of a
cycle of forms could never be clearly traced to its
various factors, if Sexual Selection had also to be
taken into consideration. Thus, we may fairly
suppose that many features in the markings of
butterflies owe their origin to Sexual Selection,
but we are, at least at present, quite in the dark
as to how many and which of these characters
can be traced to this factor.</p>

<p>An investigation such as that which has been
kept in view in this second essay would have been
impracticable in the case of butterflies, as well as
in the analogous case of the colouring and marking
of birds, because it would have always been
doubtful whether a character which did not
appear to be attributable to any of the other
transforming factors, should not be referred to
Sexual Selection. It would have been impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">xxii</a></span>
either to exclude or to infer an unknown developmental
force, since we should have had to
deal with two unknowns which could in no way be
kept separate.</p>

<p>We escape this dilemma in the markings of
caterpillars, because the latter do not propagate
in this state. If the phenomena are not here entirely
referable to Natural Selection and the direct
action of the environment&mdash;if there remains an
inexplicable residue, this cannot be referred to
Sexual Selection, but to some as yet unknown
power.</p>

<p>But it is not only in this respect that caterpillars
offer especial advantages. If it is to be
attempted to trace transformations in form to the
action of the environment, an exact knowledge of
this environment is in the first place necessary,
<i>i.e.</i> a precise acquaintance with the conditions of
life under the influence of which the species concerned
exist. With respect to caterpillars, our
knowledge of the life conditions is certainly by no
means as complete as might be supposed, when
we consider that hundreds of Lepidopterists have
constantly bred and observed them during a most
extended period. Much may have been observed,
but it has not been thought worthy of publication;
much has also been published, but so scattered
and disconnected and at the same time of such
unequal credibility, that a lifetime would be required
to sift and collect it. A comprehensive biology of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</a></span>
caterpillars, based on a broad ground, is as yet
wanting, although such a labour would be both most
interesting and valuable. Nevertheless, we know
considerably more of the life of caterpillars than
of any other larvæ, and as we are also acquainted
with an immense number of species and are able
to compare their life and the phenomena of their
development, the subject of the markings of
caterpillars must from this side also appear as the
most favourable for the problem set before us.</p>

<p>To this must be added as a last, though not as
the least, valuable circumstance, that we have
here preserved to us in the development of the
individual a fragment of the history of the species,
so that we thus have at hand a means of following
the course which the characters to be traced to
their causes&mdash;the forms of marking&mdash;have taken
during the lapse of thousands of years.</p>

<p>If with reference to the question as to the
precise conditions of life in caterpillars I was
frequently driven to my own observations, it was
because I found as good as no previous work
bearing upon this subject. It was well known
generally that many caterpillars were differently
marked and coloured when young to what they
were when old; in some very striking cases brief
notices of this fact are to be found in the <span class="locked">works,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">xxiv</a></span>
more especially, of the older writers, and principally
in that of the excellent observer Rösel von
Rosenhof, the Nuremberg naturalist and miniature
painter. In no single case, however, do the
available materials suffice when we have to draw
conclusions respecting the phyletic development.
We distinctly see here how doubtful is the value
of those observations which are made, so to
speak, at random, <i>i.e.</i> without some definite
object in view. Many of these observations may
be both good and correct, but they are frequently
wanting precisely in that which would make them
available for scientific purposes. Thus everything
had to be established <i>de novo</i>, and for this
reason the investigations were extended over a
considerable number of years, and had to be
restricted to a small and as sharply defined a
group as possible&mdash;a group which was easily
surveyed, viz. that of the Hawk-moths or
Sphinges.</p>

<p>Since the appearance of the German edition of
this work many new observations respecting the
markings of caterpillars have been published,
such, for example, as those of W. H. Edwards
and Fritz Müller. I have, however, made but
little use of them here, as I had no intention of
giving anything like a <i>complete</i> ontogeny of the
markings in all caterpillars: larval markings were
with me but means to an end, and I wished
only to bring together such a number of facts as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">xxv</a></span>
were necessary for drawing certain general conclusions.
It would indeed be most interesting to
extend such observations to other groups of
Lepidoptera.</p>

<p>The third essay also, for similar reasons, is
based essentially upon the same materials, viz.
the Lepidoptera. It is therein attempted to
approach the general problem&mdash;does there or
does there not exist an internal transforming
force?&mdash;from a quite different and, I may say,
opposite point of view. The form-relationships
of Lepidoptera in their two chief stages of development,
imago and larva, are therein analysed,
and by an examination of the respective forms it
has been attempted to discover the nature of the
causes which have led thereto.</p>

<p>I may be permitted to say that the fact here
disclosed of a <i>different morphological</i>, with the
<i>same genealogical</i> relationship, appears to me to
be of decided importance. The agreement of the
conclusions following therefrom with the results
of the former investigation has, at least in my own
mind, removed the last doubts as to the correctness
of the latter.</p>

<p>The fourth and shortest essay on the “Transformation
of the Axolotl into Amblystoma,” starts
primarily with the intention of showing that cases
of sudden transformation are no proof of <i>per
saltum</i> development. When this essay first appeared
the view was still widely entertained that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">xxvi</a></span>
we had here a case proving <i>per saltum</i> development.
That this explanation was erroneous is now
generally admitted, but I believe that those who
suppose that we have here to deal with some quite
ordinary phenomenon which requires no explanation,
now go too far towards the other extreme. The
term “larval reproduction” is an <i>expression</i>, but
no <i>explanation</i>; we have therefore to attempt to
find out the true interpretation, but whether the
one which I have given is correct must be judged
of by others.</p>

<p>These four essays lead up to a fifth and concluding
one “On the Mechanical Conception of
Nature.” Whilst the results obtained are here
summed up, it is attempted to form them into a
philosophical conception of Nature and of the
Universe. It will be thought by many that this
should have been left to professed philosophers,
and I readily admit that I made this attempt with
some misgiving. Two considerations, however,
induced me to express here my own views. The
first was that the facts of science are frequently
misunderstood, or at any rate not estimated at
their true value, by <span class="locked">philosophers;<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span> the second
consideration was, that even certain naturalists
and certainly very many non-naturalists, turn distrustfully
from the results of science, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">xxvii</a></span>
they fear that these would infallibly lead to a view
of the Universe which is to them unacceptable,
viz. the materialistic view. With regard to the
former I wished to show that the views of the
development of organic Nature inaugurated by
Darwin and defended in this work are certainly
correctly designated <i>mechanical</i>; with reference
to the latter I wished to prove that such a mechanical
conception of the organic world and of
Nature in general, by no means leads merely to
one single philosophical conception of Nature, viz.
to Materialism, but that on the contrary it rather
admits of legitimate development in a quite
different manner.</p>

<p>Thus in these last four essays much that
appears heterogeneous will be found in close
association, viz. scientific details and general
philosophical ideas. In truth, however, these are
most intimately connected, and the one cannot
dispense with the other. As the detailed investigations
of the three essays find their highest
value in the general considerations of the fourth,
and were indeed only possible by constantly
keeping this end in view, so the general conclusions
could only grow out of the results of the
special investigations as out of a solid foundation.
Had the new materials here brought together
been already known, the reader would certainly
have been spared the trouble of going into the
details of special scientific research. But as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">xxviii</a></span>
matters stood it was indispensable that the facts
should be examined into and established even
down to the most trifling details. The essay
“On the Origin of the Markings of Caterpillars”
especially, had obviously to commence with the
sifting and compilation of extensive morphological
materials.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Origin and Significance of Seasonal
Dimorphism.</span></span></h4>

<p>The phenomena here about to be subjected to a
closer investigation have been known for a long
period of time. About the year 1830 it was shown
that the two forms of a butterfly (<i>Araschnia</i>) which
had till that time been regarded as distinct, in spite
of their different colouring and marking really belonged
to the same species, the two forms of this
dimorphic species not appearing simultaneously
but at different seasons of the year, the one in
early spring, the other in summer. To this phenomenon
the term “seasonal dimorphism” was
subsequently applied by Mr. A. R. Wallace, an
expression of which the heterogeneous composition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
may arouse the horror of the philologist, but, as it
is as concise and intelligible as possible, I propose
to retain it in the present work.</p>

<p>The species of <i>Araschnia</i> through which the
discovery of seasonal dimorphism was made,
formerly bore the two specific names <i>A. Levana</i>
and <i>A. Prorsa</i>. The latter is the summer and the
former the winter form, the difference between the
two being, to the uninitiated, so great that it is difficult
to believe in their relationship. <i>A. Levana</i>
(Figs. 1 and 2, <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>.) is of a golden brown
colour with black spots and dashes, while <i>A.
Prorsa</i> (Figs. 5 and 6, <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>.) is deep black
with a broad white interrupted band across both
wings. Notwithstanding this difference, it is
an undoubted fact that both forms are merely the
winter and summer generations of the same species.
I have myself frequently bred the variety <i>Prorsa</i>
from the eggs of <i>Levana</i>, and <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p>Since the discovery of this last fact a considerable
number of similar cases have been established.
Thus P. C. <span class="locked">Zeller<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span> showed, by experiments made
under confinement, that two butterflies belonging to
the family of the ‘Blues,’ differing greatly in colour
and marking, and especially in size, which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
formerly been distinguished as <i>Plebeius</i> (<i>Lycæna</i>)
<i>Polysperchon</i> and <i>P. Amyntas</i>, were merely winter
and summer generations of the same species; and
that excellent Lepidopterist, Dr. Staudinger, proved
the <span class="locked">same<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span> with species belonging to the family of
the ‘Whites,’ <i>Euchloe Belia</i> Esp. and <i>E. Ausonia</i>
Hüb., which are found in the Mediterranean
countries.</p>

<p>The instances are not numerous, however, in
which the difference between the winter and summer
forms of a species is so great as to cause them
to be treated of in systematic work as distinct
species. I know of only five of these cases.
Lesser differences, having the systematic value of
varieties, occur much more frequently. Thus, for
instance, seasonal dimorphism has been proved to
exist among many of our commonest butterflies
belonging to the family of the ‘Whites,’ but the
difference in their colour and marking can only be
detected after some attention; while with other
species, as for instance with the commonest of our
small ‘Blues,’ <i>Plebeius Alexis</i> (= <i>Icarus</i>, Rott.),
the difference is so slight that even the initiated
must examine closely in order to recognize it.
Indeed whole series of species might easily be
grouped so as to show the transition from complete
similarity of both generations, through scarcely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>perceptible differences, to divergence to the extent
of varieties, and finally to that of species.</p>

<p>Nor are the instances of lesser differences between
the two generations very numerous. Among
the European diurnal Lepidoptera I know of
about twelve cases, although closer observation in
this direction may possibly lead to further <span class="locked">discoveries.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span>
Seasonal dimorphism occurs also in
moths, although I am not in a position to make a
more precise statement on this <span class="locked">subject,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span> as my own
observations refer only to butterflies.</p>

<p>That other orders of insects do not present the
same phenomenon depends essentially upon the
fact that most of them produce only one generation
in the year; but amongst the remaining orders
there occur indeed changes of form which, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
not capable of being regarded as pure seasonal
dimorphism, may well have been produced in part
by the same causes, as the subsequent investigation
on the relation of seasonal dimorphism to
alternation of generation and heterogenesis will
more fully prove.</p>

<p>Now what are these causes?</p>

<p>Some years ago, when I imparted to a lepidopterist
my intention of investigating the origin of
this enigmatical dimorphism, in the hope of profiting
for my inquiry from his large experience, I
received the half-provoking reply: “But there is
nothing to investigate: it is simply the specific
character of this insect to appear in two forms;
these two forms alternate with each other in regular
succession according to a fixed law of Nature, and
with this we must be satisfied.” From his point
of view the position was right; according to the
old doctrine of species no question ought to be
asked as to the causes of such phenomena in particular.
I would not, however, allow myself to be
thus discouraged, but undertook a series of investigations,
the results of which I here submit to the
reader.</p>

<p>The first conjecture was, that the differences in
the imago might perhaps be of a secondary nature,
and have their origin in the differences of the caterpillar,
especially with those species which grow
up during the spring or autumn and feed on different
plants, thus assimilating different chemical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
substances, which might induce different deposits
of colour in the wings of the perfect insect. This
latter hypothesis was readily confuted by the fact,
that the most strongly marked of the dimorphic
species, <i>A. Levana</i>, fed exclusively on <i>Urtica major</i>.
The caterpillar of this species certainly exhibits a
well-defined dimorphism, but it is not seasonal
dimorphism: the two forms do not alternate with
each other, but appear mixed in every brood.</p>

<p>I have repeatedly reared the rarer golden-brown
variety of the caterpillar separately, but precisely
the same forms of butterfly were developed as
from black caterpillars bred at the same time under
similar external conditions. The same experiment
was performed, with a similar result, in the
last century by Rösel, the celebrated miniature
painter and observer of nature, and author of the
well-known “Insect Diversions”&mdash;a work in use
up to the present day.</p>

<p>The question next arises, as to whether the
causes originating the phenomena are not the same
as those to which we ascribe the change of winter
and summer covering in so many mammalia and
birds&mdash;whether the change of colour and marking
does not depend, in this as in the other cases, upon
the <i>indirect action</i> of external conditions of life,
i.e., on adaptation through natural selection. We
are certainly correct in ascribing white coloration
to <span class="locked">adaptation<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span>&mdash;as with the ptarmigan, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
white in winter and of a grey-brown in summer,
both colours of the species being evidently of
important use.</p>

<p>It might be imagined that analogous phenomena
occur in butterflies, with the difference that the
change of colour, instead of taking place in the
same brood, alternates in different <span class="locked">broods.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span> The
nature of the difference which occurs in seasonal
dimorphism, however, decidedly excludes this view;
and moreover, the environment of butterflies
presents such similar features, whether they emerge
in spring or in summer, that all notions that we
may be dealing with adaptational colours must be
entirely abandoned.</p>

<p>I have <span class="locked">elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span> endeavoured to show that
butterflies in general are not coloured protectively
during flight, for the double reason that the colour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
of the background to which they are exposed continually
changes, and because, even with the best
adaptation to the background, the fluttering motion
of the wings would betray them to the eyes of
their <span class="locked">enemies.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span> I attempted also to prove at the
same time that the diurnal Lepidoptera of our
temperate zone have few enemies which pursue
them when on the wing, but that they are subject
to many attacks during their period of repose.</p>

<p>In support of this last statement I may here
adduce an instance. In the summer of 1869 I
placed about seventy specimens of <i>Araschnia
Prorsa</i> in a spacious case, plentifully supplied with
flowers. Although the insects found themselves
quite at home, and settled about the flowers in
very fine weather (one pair copulated, and the
female laid eggs), yet I found some dead and
mangled every morning. This decimation continued&mdash;many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
disappearing entirely without my
being able to find their remains&mdash;until after the
ninth day, when they had all, with one exception,
been slain by their nocturnal foes&mdash;probably
spiders and <i>Opilionidæ</i>.</p>

<p>Diurnal Lepidoptera in a position of rest are
especially exposed to hostile attacks. In this
position, as is well known, their wings are closed
upright, and it is evident that the adaptational
colours on the under side are displayed, as is most
clearly shown by many of our native <span class="locked">species.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span></p>

<p>Now, the differences in the most pronounced
cases of seasonal dimorphism&mdash;for example, in
<i>Araschnia Levana</i>&mdash;are much less manifest on the
<i>under</i> than on the <i>upper</i> side of the wing. The
explanation by adaptation is therefore untenable;
but I will not here pause to confute this view more
completely, as I believe I shall be able to show
the true cause of the phenomenon.</p>

<p>If seasonal dimorphism does not arise from the
<i>indirect</i> influence of varying seasons of the year,
it may result from the <i>direct</i> influence of the
varying external conditions of life, which are,
without doubt, different in the winter from those
of the summer brood.</p>

<p>There are two prominent factors from which
such an influence may be expected&mdash;temperature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
and duration of development, i.e., duration of the
chrysalis period. The duration of the larval
period need not engage our attention, as it is only
very little shorter in the winter brood&mdash;at least, it
was so with the species employed in the experiments.</p>

<p>Starting from these two points of view, I carried
on experiments for a number of years, in order to
find out whether the dual form of the species in
question could be traced back to the direct action
of the influences mentioned.</p>

<p>The first experiments were made with <i>Araschnia
Levana</i>. From the eggs of the winter generation,
which had emerged as butterflies in April, I bred
caterpillars, and immediately after pupation placed
them in a refrigerator, the temperature of the air
of which was 8°-10° R. It appeared, however,
that the development could not thus be retarded
to any desired period by such a small diminution
of temperature, for, when the box was taken out
of the refrigerator after thirty-four days, all the
butterflies, about forty in number, had emerged,
many being dead, and others still living. The
experiment was so far successful that, instead of
the <i>Prorsa</i> form which might have been expected
under ordinary circumstances, most of the butterflies
emerged as the so-called <i>Porima</i> (Figs. 3, 4,
7, 8, and 9, <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>.); that is to say, in a form intermediate
between <i>Prorsa</i> and <i>Levana</i> sometimes
found in nature, and possessing more or less the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
marking of the former, but mixed with much of
the yellow of <i>Levana</i>.</p>

<p>It should be here mentioned, that similar experiments
were made in 1864 by George Dorfmeister,
but unfortunately I did not get this <span class="locked">information<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span>
until my own were nearly completed. In
these well-conceived, but rather too complicated
experiments, the author arrives at the conclusion
“that temperature certainly affects the colouring,
and through it the marking, of the future butterfly,
and chiefly so during pupation.” By lowering the
temperature of the air during a portion of the
pupal period, the author was enabled to produce
single specimens of <i>Porima</i>, but most of the butterflies
retained the <i>Prorsa</i> form. Dorfmeister employed
a temperature a little higher than I did in
my first experiments, viz. 10°-11° R., and did
not leave the pupæ long exposed, but after 5½-8
days removed them to a higher temperature. It
was therefore evident that he produced transition
forms in a few instances only, and that he never
succeeded in bringing about a complete transformation
of the summer into the winter form.</p>

<p>In my subsequent experiments I always exposed
the pupæ to a temperature of 0°-1° R.;
they were placed directly in the refrigerator, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
taken out at the end of four weeks. I started with
the idea that it was perhaps not so much the reduced
temperature as the retardation of development
which led to the transformation. But the
first experiment had shown that the butterflies
emerged between 8° and 10° R., and consequently
that the development could not be retarded
at this temperature.</p>

<p>A very different result was obtained from the experiment
made at a lower <span class="locked">temperature.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span> Of twenty
butterflies, fifteen had become transformed into
<i>Porima</i>, and of these three appeared very similar
to the winter form (<i>Levana</i>), differing only in the
absence of the narrow blue marginal line, which
is seldom absent in the true <i>Levana</i>. Five butterflies
were uninfluenced by the cold, and remained
unchanged, emerging as the ordinary summer
form (<i>Prorsa</i>). It thus appeared from this experiment,
that a large proportion of the butterflies
inclined to the <i>Levana</i> form by exposure to a
temperature of 0°-1° R. for four weeks, while
in a few specimens the transformation into this
form was nearly perfect.</p>

<p>Should it not be possible to perfect the transformation,
so that each individual should take the
<i>Levana</i> form? If the assumption of the <i>Prorsa</i> or
<i>Levana</i> form depends only on the direct influence
of temperature, or on the duration of the period of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
development, it should be possible to compel the
pupæ to take one or the other form at pleasure, by
the application of the necessary external conditions.
This has never been accomplished with <i>Araschnia
Prorsa</i>. As in the experiment already described,
and in all subsequent ones, single specimens appeared
as the unchanged summer form, others
showed an appearance of transition, and but very
few had changed so completely as to be possibly
taken for the pure <i>Levana</i>. In some species of the
sub-family <i>Pierinæ</i>, however, at least in the case
of the summer brood, there was, on the contrary,
a complete transformation.</p>

<p>Most of the species of our ‘Whites’ (<i>Pierinæ</i>)
exhibit the phenomenon of seasonal dimorphism,
the winter and summer forms being remarkably
distinct. In <i>Pieris Napi</i> (with which species I
chiefly experimented) the winter form (Figs. 10
and 11, <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>.) has a sprinkling of deep black
scales at the base of the wings on the upper side,
while the tips are more grey, and have in all cases
much less black than in the summer form; on the
underside the difference lies mainly in the frequent
breadth, and dark greenish-black dusting, of the
veins of the hind wings in the winter form, while
in the summer form these greenish-black veins
are but faintly present.</p>

<p>I placed numerous specimens of the summer
brood, immediately after their transformation into
chrysalides, in the refrigerator (0°-1° R.), where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
I left them for three months, transferring them to
a hothouse on September 11th, and there (from
September 26th to October 3rd) sixty butterflies
emerged, the whole of which, without exception&mdash;and
most of them in an unusually strong degree&mdash;bore
the characters of the winter form. I, at least,
have never observed in the natural state such a
strong yellow on the underside of the hind wings,
and such a deep blackish-green veining, as prevailed
in these specimens (see, for instance, <a href="#Plate_I">Figs.
10 and 11</a>). The temperature of the hothouse
(12°-24° R.) did not, however, cause the emergence
of the whole of the pupæ; a portion hibernated,
and produced in the following spring
butterflies of the winter form only. I thus succeeded,
with this species of <i>Pieris</i>, in completely
changing every individual of the summer generation
into the winter form.</p>

<p>It might be expected that the same result could
be more readily obtained with <i>A. Levana</i>, and
fresh experiments were undertaken, in order that
the pupæ might remain in the refrigerator fully
two months from the period of their transformation
(9&ndash;10th July). But the result obtained was
the same as before&mdash;fifty-seven butterflies emerged
in the <span class="locked">hothouse<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span> from September 19th to October
4th, nearly all of these approaching very near to
the winter form, without a single specimen presenting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
the appearance of a perfect <i>Levana</i>, while
three were of the pure summer form (<i>Prorsa</i>).</p>

<p>Thus with <i>Levana</i> it was not possible, by refrigeration
and retardation of development, to change
the summer completely into the winter form in all
specimens. It may, of course, be objected that
the period of refrigeration had been too short,
and that, instead of leaving the pupæ in the refrigerator
for two months, they should have remained
there six months, that is, about as long as the
winter brood remains under natural conditions in
the chrysalis state. The force of this last objection
must be recognized, notwithstanding the improbability
that the desired effect would be produced
by a longer period of cold, since the doubling
of this period from four to eight weeks did not
<span class="locked">produce<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> any decided increase in the strength of
the transformation. I should not have omitted
to repeat the experiment in this modified form,
but unfortunately, in spite of all trouble, I was
unable to collect during the summer of 1873 a
sufficient number of caterpillars. But the omission
thus caused is of quite minor importance from a
theoretical point of view.</p>

<p>For let us assume that the omitted experiment
had been performed&mdash;that pupæ of the summer
brood were retarded in their development by cold
until the following spring, and that every specimen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
then emerged in the perfect winter form, Levana.
Such a result, taken in connexion with the corresponding
experiment upon <i>Pieris Napi</i>, would
warrant the conclusion that the direct action of a
certain amount of cold (or of retardation of development)
is able to compel all pupæ, from whichever
generation derived, to assume the winter
form of the species. From this the converse
would necessarily follow, viz. that a certain amount
of warmth would lead to the production of the
summer form, <i>Prorsa</i>, it being immaterial from
which brood the pupæ thus exposed to warmth
might be derived. But the latter conclusion was
proved experimentally to be incorrect, and thus
the former falls with it, whether the imagined experiment
with <i>Prorsa</i> had succeeded or not.</p>

<p>I have repeatedly attempted by the application
of warmth to change the winter into the summer
form, but always with the same negative result.
<i>It is not possible to compel the winter brood to
assume the form of the summer generation.</i></p>

<p><i>A. Levana</i> may produce not only two but three
broods in the year, and may, therefore, be said to
be <i>polygoneutic</i>.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> One winter brood alternates
with two summer broods, the first of which appears
in July, and the second in August. The latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
furnishes a fourth generation of pupæ, which, after
hibernation, emerge in April, as the first brood of
butterflies in the form <i>Levana</i>.</p>

<p>I frequently placed pupæ of this fourth brood in
the hothouse immediately after their transformation,
and in some cases even during the caterpillar
stage, the temperature never falling, even at night,
below 12° R., and often rising during the day to
24° R. The result was always the same: all, or
nearly all, the pupæ hibernated, and emerged the
following year in the winter form as perfectly pure
<i>Levana</i>, without any trace of transition to the
<i>Prorsa</i> form. On one occasion only was there a
<i>Porima</i> among them, a case for which an explanation
will, I believe, be found later on. It often
happened, on the other hand, that some few of the
butterflies emerged in the autumn, about fourteen
days after pupation; and these were always <i>Prorsa</i>
(the summer form), excepting once a <i>Porima</i>.</p>

<p>From these experiments it appeared that similar
causes (heat) affect different generations of <i>A.
Levana</i> in different manners. With both summer
broods a high temperature always caused the
appearance of <i>Prorsa</i>, this form arising but seldom
from the third brood (and then only in a few individuals),
while the greater number retained the
<i>Levana</i> form unchanged. We may assign as the
reason for this behaviour, that the third brood has
no further tendency to be accelerated in its development
by the action of heat, but that by a longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
duration of the pupal stage the <i>Levana</i> form must
result. On one occasion the chrysalis stage was
considerably shortened in this brood by the
continued action of a high temperature, many
specimens thus having their period of development
reduced from six to three months. The
supposed explanation above given is, however, in
reality no explanation at all, but simply a restatement
of the facts. The question still remains, why
the third brood in particular has no tendency to
be accelerated in its development by the action of
heat, as is the case with both the previous broods?</p>

<p>The first answer that can be given to this
question is, that the cause of the different action
produced by a similar agency can only lie in the
<i>constitution</i>, i.e., in the <i>physical nature</i> of the
broods in question, and not in the external influences
by which they are acted upon. Now,
what is the difference in the physical nature of
these respective broods? It is quite evident, as
shown by the experiments already described, that
cold and warmth cannot be the <i>immediate</i> causes
of a pupa emerging in the <i>Prorsa</i> or <i>Levana</i> form,
since the last brood always gives rise to the
<i>Levana</i> form, whether acted on by cold or warmth.
The first and second broods only can be made to
partly assume, more or less completely, the <i>Levana</i>
form by the application of cold. In these broods
then, a low temperature is the <i>mediate</i> cause of the
transformation into the <i>Levana</i> form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
The following is my explanation of the facts.
The form <i>Levana</i> is the original type of the
species, and <i>Prorsa</i> the secondary form arising
from the gradual operation of summer climate.
When we are able to change many specimens of
the summer brood into the winter form by means
of cold, this can only depend upon reversion to
the original, or ancestral, form, which reversion appears
to be most readily produced by cold, that is,
by the same external influences as those to which
the original form was exposed during a long period
of time, and the continuance of which has preserved,
in the winter generations, the colour and marking
of the original form down to the present time.</p>

<p>I consider the origination of the <i>Prorsa</i> from the
<i>Levana</i> form to have been somewhat as follows:&mdash;It
is certain that during the diluvial period in
Europe there was a so-called ‘glacial epoch,’ which
may have spread a truly polar climate over our
temperate zone; or perhaps a lesser degree of cold
may have prevailed with increased atmospheric
precipitation. At all events, the summer was then
short and comparatively cold, and the existing
butterflies could have only produced one generation
in the year; in other words, they were <i>monogoneutic</i>.
At that time <i>A. Levana</i> existed only in
the <i>Levana</i> <span class="locked">form.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span> As the climate gradually became
warmer, a period must have arrived when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
the summer lasted long enough for the interpolation
of a second brood. The pupæ of <i>Levana</i>, which
had hitherto hibernated through the long winter
to appear as butterflies in the following summer,
were now able to appear on the wing as butterflies
during the same summer as that in which they left
their eggs as larvæ, and eggs deposited by the last
brood produced larvæ which fed up and hibernated
as pupæ. A state of things was thus established
in which the first brood was developed under very
different climatic conditions from the second. So
considerable a difference in colour and marking
between the two forms as we now witness could
not have arisen suddenly, but must have done so
gradually. It is evident from the foregoing experiments
that the <i>Prorsa</i> form did not originate
suddenly. Had this been the case it would simply
signify that every individual of this species possessed
the faculty of assuming two different forms
according as it was acted on by warmth or cold,
just in the same manner as litmus-paper becomes
red in acids and blue in alkalies. The experiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
have shown, however, that this is not the case, but
rather that the last generation bears an ineradicable
tendency to take the <i>Levana</i> form, and is
not susceptible to the influence of warmth, however
long continued; while both summer generations,
on the contrary, show a decided tendency to assume
the <i>Prorsa</i> form, although they certainly can be
made to assume the <i>Levana</i> form in different
degrees by the prolonged action of cold.</p>

<p>The conclusion seems to me inevitable, that the
origination of the <i>Prorsa</i> form was gradual&mdash;that
those changes which originated in the chemistry
of the pupal stage, and led finally to the <i>Prorsa</i>
type, occurred very gradually, at first perhaps
remaining completely latent throughout a series
of generations, then very slight changes of marking
appearing, and finally, after a long period
of time, the complete <i>Prorsa</i> type was produced.
It appears to me that the quoted results of the
experiments are not only easily explained on the
view of the <i>gradual</i> action of climate, but that this
view is the only one admissible. The action of
climate is best comparable with the so-called
cumulative effect of certain drugs on the human
body; the first small dose produces scarcely any
perceptible change, but if often repeated the effect
becomes cumulative, and poisoning occurs.</p>

<p>This view of the action of climate is not at all
new, most zoologists having thus represented it;
only the formal proof of this action is new, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
the facts investigated appear to me of special importance
as furnishing this proof. I shall again
return to this view in considering climatic varieties,
and it will then appear that also the nature of the
transformation itself confirms the slow operation
of climate.</p>

<p>During the transition from the glacial period to
the present climate <i>A. Levana</i> thus gradually
changed from a monogoneutic to a digoneutic
species, and at the same time became gradually
more distinctly dimorphic, this character originating
only through the alteration of the summer
brood, the primary colouring and marking of the
species being retained unchanged by the winter
brood. As the summer became longer a third
generation could be interpolated&mdash;the species
became polygoneutic; and in this manner two
summer generations alternated with one winter
generation.</p>

<p>We have now to inquire whether facts are
in complete accordance with this theory&mdash;whether
they are never at variance with it&mdash;and whether
they can all be explained by it. I will at once
state in anticipation, that this is the case to the
fullest extent.</p>

<p>In the first place, the theory readily explains
why the summer but not the winter generations
are capable of being transformed; the latter cannot
possibly revert to the <i>Prorsa</i> form, because
this is much the younger. When, however, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
happens that out of a hundred cases there occurs
one in which a chrysalis of the winter generation,
having been forced by warmth, undergoes
transformation before the commencement
of winter, and emerges in the summer <span class="locked">form,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span> this
is not in the least inexplicable. It cannot be
atavism which determines the direction of the
development; but we see from such a case that
the changes in the first two generations have
already produced a certain alteration in the third,
which manifests itself in single cases under favourable
conditions (the influence of warmth) by the
assumption of the <i>Prorsa</i> form; or, as it might be
otherwise expressed, the <i>alternating</i> heredity (of
which we shall speak further), which implies the
power of assuming the <i>Prorsa</i> form, remains latent
as a rule in the winter generation, but becomes
<i>continuous</i> in single individuals.</p>

<p>It is true that we have as yet no kind of insight
into the nature of heredity, and this at once shows
the defectiveness of the foregoing explanation; but
we nevertheless know many of its external phenomena.
We know for certain that one of these
consists in the fact that peculiarities of the father
do not appear in the son, but in the grandson,
or still further on, and that they may be thus
transmitted in a latent form. Let us imagine a
character so transmitted that it appears in the
first, third, and fifth generations, remaining latent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
in the intermediate ones; it would not be improbable,
according to previous experiences, that the
peculiarity should exceptionally, i.e., from a cause
unknown to us, appear in single individuals of the
second or fourth generation. But this completely
agrees with those cases in which “exceptional”
individuals of the winter brood took the <i>Prorsa</i>
form, with the difference only that a cause (warmth)
was here apparent which occasioned the development
of the latent characters, although we are not
in a position to say in what manner heat produces
this action. These exceptions to the rule are
therefore no objection to the theory. On the contrary,
they give us a hint that after one <i>Prorsa</i>
generation had been produced, the gradual interpolation
of a second <i>Prorsa</i> generation may have
been facilitated by the existence of the first. I do
not doubt that even in the natural state single
individuals of <i>Prorsa</i> sometimes emerge in September
or October; and if our summer were
lengthened by only one or two months this might
give rise to a third summer brood (just as a second
is now an accomplished fact), under which circumstances
they would not only emerge, but would
also have time for copulation and for depositing
eggs, the larvæ from which would have time to
grow up.</p>

<p>A sharp distinction must be made between the
first establishment of a new climatic form and the
transference of the latter to newly interpolated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
generations. The former always takes place very
slowly; the latter may occur in a shorter time.</p>

<p>With regard to the duration of time which is
necessary to produce a new form by the influence
of climate, or to transmit to a succeeding generation
a new form already established, great
differences occur, according to the physical nature
of the species and of the individual. The experiments
with <i>Prorsa</i> already described show how
diverse are individual proclivities in this respect.
In Experiment No. 12 it was not possible out of
seventy individuals to substitute <i>Prorsa</i> for the
<i>Levana</i> form, even in one solitary case, or, in
other words, to change alternating into continuous
inheritance; whilst in the corresponding experiments
of former years (Experiment 10, for
example), out of an equal number of pupæ three
emerged as <i>Prorsa</i>, and one as <i>Porima</i>. We
might be inclined to seek for the cause of this
different behaviour in external influences, but we
should not thus arrive at an explanation of the
facts. We might suppose, for instance, that a
great deal depended upon the particular period of
the pupal stage at which the action of the elevated
temperature began&mdash;whether on the first, the
thirtieth, or the hundredth day after pupation&mdash;and
this conjecture is correct in so far that in the
two last cases warmth can have no further influence
than that of somewhat accelerating the emergence
of the butterflies, but cannot change the <i>Levana</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
into the <i>Prorsa</i> form. I have repeatedly exposed
a large number of <i>Levana</i> pupæ of the third
generation to the temperature of an apartment, or
even still higher (26° R.), during winter, but no
<i>Prorsa</i> were <span class="locked">obtained.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span></p>

<p>But it would be erroneous to assume a difference
in the action of heat according as it began on the
first or third day after transformation; whether
during or before pupation. This is best proved
by Experiment No. 12, in which caterpillars of
the fourth generation were placed in the hothouse
several days before they underwent pupation;
still, not a single butterfly assumed the <i>Prorsa</i>
form. I have also frequently made the reverse
experiment, and exposed caterpillars of the first
summer brood to cold during the act of pupation.
A regular consequence was the dying off of the
caterpillars, which is little to be wondered at, as
the sensitiveness of insects during ecdysis is well
known, and transformation into the pupal state is
attended by much deeper changes.</p>

<p>Dorfmeister thought that he might conclude
from his experiments that temperature exerts the
greatest influence in the first place during the act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
of pupation, and in the next place immediately
after that period. His experiments were made,
however, with such a small number of specimens
that scarcely any safe conclusion can be founded
on them; still, this conclusion may be correct, in
so far as everything depends on whether, from
the beginning, the formative processes in the
pupa tended to this or that direction, the final
result of which is the <i>Prorsa</i> or <i>Levana</i> form. If
once there is a tendency to one or the other
direction, then temperature might exert an accelerating
or a retarding influence, but the tendency
cannot be further changed.</p>

<p>It is also possible&mdash;indeed, probable&mdash;that a
period may be fixed in which warmth or cold
might be able to divert the original direction of
development most easily; and this is the next
problem to be attacked, the answer to which, now
that the main points have been determined, should
not be very difficult. I have often contemplated
taking the experiments in hand myself, but have
abandoned them, because my materials did not
appear to me sufficiently extensive, and in all
such experiments nothing is to be more avoided
than a frittering away of experimental materials
by a too complicated form of problem.</p>

<p>There may indeed be a period most favourable
for the action of temperature during the first
days of the pupal stage; it appears from Experiment
No. 12 that individuals tend in different degrees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
to respond to such influences, and that the disposition
to abandon the ordinary course of
development is different in different individuals.
In no other way can it be explained that, in all
the experiments made with the first and second
generations of <i>Prorsa</i>, only <i>a portion</i> of the pupæ
were compelled by cold to take the direction of
development of <i>Levana</i>, and that even from the
former only a few individuals completely reverted,
the majority remaining intermediate.</p>

<p>If it be asked why in the corresponding experiments
with <i>Pieris Napi</i> complete reversion
always occurred without exception, it may be
supposed that in this species the summer form has
not been so long in existence, and that it would
thus be more easily abandoned; or, that the
difference between the two generations has not
become so distinct, which further signifies that
here again the summer form is of later origin. It
might also be finally answered, that the tendency
to reversion in different species may vary just as
much as in different individuals of the same
species. But, in any case, the fact is established
that all individuals are impelled by cold to complete
reversion, and that in these experiments it
does not depend so particularly upon the moment
of development when cold is applied, but that differences
of individual constitution are much more the
cause why cold brings some pupæ to complete, and
others to partial, reversion, while yet others are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
quite uninfluenced. In reference to this, the
American <i>Papilio Ajax</i> is particularly interesting.</p>

<p>This butterfly, which is somewhat similar to
the European <i>P. Podalirius</i>, appears, wherever it
occurs, in three varieties, designated as var. <i>Telamonides</i>,
var. <i>Walshii</i>, and var. <i>Marcellus</i>. The
distinguished American entomologist, W. H. Edwards,
has proved by breeding experiments, that
all three forms belong to the same cycle of development,
and in such a manner that the first
two appear only in spring, and always come only
from hibernating pupæ, while the last form, var.
<i>Marcellus</i>, appears only in summer, and then in
three successive generations. A seasonal dimorphism
thus appears which is combined with
ordinary dimorphism, winter and summer forms
alternating with each other; but the first appears
itself in two forms or varieties, vars. <i>Telamonides</i>
and <i>Walshii</i>. If for the present we disregard
this complication, and consider these two winter
forms as one, we should thus have four generations,
of which the first possesses the winter form, and
the three succeeding ones have, on the other hand,
the summer form, var. <i>Marcellus</i>.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of this species consists in the
fact that in all three summer generations only a
portion of the pupæ emerge after a short period
(fourteen days), whilst another and much smaller
portion remains in the pupal state during the
whole summer and succeeding winter, first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
emerging in the following spring, and then always
in the winter form. Thus, Edwards states that
out of fifty chrysalides of the second generation,
which had pupated at the end of June, forty-five
<i>Marcellus</i> butterflies appeared after fourteen days,
whilst five pupæ emerged in April of the following
year, and then as <i>Telamonides</i>.</p>

<p>The explanation of these facts is easily afforded
by the foregoing theory. According to this, both
the winter forms must be regarded as primary,
and the <i>Marcellus</i> form as secondary. But this
last is not yet so firmly established as <i>Prorsa</i>, in
which reversion of the summer generations to the
<i>Levana</i> form only occurs through special external
influences; whilst in the case of <i>Ajax</i> some individuals
are to be found in every generation, the
tendency of which to revert is still so strong that
even the greatest summer heat is unable to cause
them to diverge from their original inherited
direction of development, or to accelerate their
emergence and compel them to assume the <i>Marcellus</i>
form. It is here beyond a doubt that it is
not different external influences, but internal
causes only, which maintain the old hereditary
tendency, for all the larvæ and pupæ of many
different broods were simultaneously exposed to
the same external influences. But, at the same
time, it is evident that these facts are not opposed
to the present theory; on the contrary, they confirm it,
inasmuch as they are readily explained on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
the basis of the theory, but can scarcely otherwise
be understood.</p>

<p>If it be asked what significance attaches to the
duplication of the winter form, it may be answered
that the species was already dimorphic at the time
when it appeared in only one annual generation.
Still, this explanation may be objected to, since a
dimorphism of this kind is not at present known,
though indeed some species exhibit a sexual
<span class="locked">dimorphism,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span> in which one sex (as, for instance,
the case of the female <i>Papilio Turnus</i>) appears
in two forms of colouring, but not a dimorphism,
as is here the case, displayed by both <span class="locked">sexes.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span>
Another suggestion, therefore, may perhaps be
offered.</p>

<p>In <i>A. Levana</i> we saw that reversion occurred
in very different degrees with different individuals,
seldom attaining to the true <i>Levana</i> form, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
generally only reaching the intermediate form
known as <i>Porima</i>. Now it would, at all events,
be astonishing if with <i>P. Ajax</i> the reversion were
always complete, as it is precisely in this case that
the tendency to individual reversion is so variable.
I might, for this reason, suppose that one of the
two winter forms, viz. the var. <i>Walshii</i>, is nothing
else than an incomplete reversion-form, corresponding
to <i>Porima</i> in the case of <i>A. Levana</i>.
Then <i>Telamonides</i> only would be the original
form of the butterfly, and this would agree with
the fact that this variety appears later in the
spring than <i>Walshii</i>. Experiments ought to be
able to decide <span class="locked">this.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span> The pupæ of the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
three generations placed upon ice should give,
for the greater part, the form <i>Telamonides</i>, for the
lesser portion <i>Walshii</i>, and for only a few, or perhaps
no individuals, the form <i>Marcellus</i>. This
prediction is based on the view that the tendency
to revert is on the whole great; that even with the
first summer generation, which was the longest
exposed to the summer climate, a portion of the
pupæ, without artificial means, always emerged as
<i>Telamonides</i>, and another portion as <i>Marcellus</i>.
The latter will perhaps now become <i>Walshii</i> by
the application of cold.</p>

<p>One would expect that the second and third
generations would revert more easily, and in a
larger percentage, than the first, because this latter
first acquired the new <i>Marcellus</i> form; but the
present experiments furnish no safe conclusion on
this point. Thus, of the first summer generation
only seven out of sixty-seven pupæ hibernated,
and these gave <i>Telamonides</i>; while of the second
generation forty out of seventy-six, and of the
third generation twenty-nine out of forty-two
pupæ hibernated. But to establish safer conclusions,
a still larger number of experiments is
necessary. According to the experience thus far
gained, one might perhaps still be inclined to
imagine that, with seasonal dimorphism, external
influences operating on the individual might
directly compel it to assume one or the other
form. I long held this view myself, but it is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
nevertheless, untenable. That cold does not
produce the one kind of marking, and warmth
the other, follows from the before-mentioned facts,
viz. that in <i>Papilio Ajax</i> every generation produces
both forms; and, further, in the case of
<i>A. Levana</i> I have frequently reared the fourth
(hibernating) generation entirely in a warm room,
and yet I have always obtained the winter form.
Still, one might be inclined not to make the temperature
<i>directly</i> responsible, but rather the retardation
or acceleration of development produced
through the action of temperature. I confess that
I for a long time believed that in this action I had
found the true cause of seasonal dimorphism.
Both with <i>A. Levana</i> and <i>P. Napi</i> the difference
between the duration of the pupal period in the
winter and summer forms is very great, lasting
as a rule, in the summer generation of <i>A. Levana</i>,
from seven to twelve days, and in the winter generation
about two hundred days. In this last species
the pupal state can certainly be shortened by
keeping them at an elevated temperature; but I
have, nevertheless, only in one case obtained two
or three butterflies at the end of December from
caterpillars that had pupated in September, these
generally emerging in the course of February and
March, and are to be seen on the wing in warm
weather during the latter month. The greatest
reduction of the pupal period still leaves for this
stage more than 100 days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
From this last observation it follows that it is
not the duration of development which, in individual
cases, determines the form of the butterfly,
and which consequently decides whether the winter
or summer form shall emerge, but that, on the
contrary, the duration of the pupal stage is dependent
on the tendency which the forthcoming
butterfly had taken in the chrysalis state. This
can be well understood when we consider that
the winter form must have had a long, and the
summer form a short pupal period, during innumerable
generations. In the former the habit of
slow development must have been just as well
established as that of rapid development in the
latter; and we cannot be at all surprised if we do
not see this habit abandoned by the winter form
when the opportunity presents itself. But that it
may be occasionally abandoned the more proves
that the duration of the pupal development less
determines the butterfly form than does the temperature
directly, in individual cases.</p>

<p>Thus, for instance, Edwards explicitly states
that, whereas the two winter forms of <i>P. Ajax</i>, viz.
the vars. <i>Walshii</i> and <i>Telamonides</i>, generally
appear only after a pupal period of 150 to 270
days, yet individual cases occur in which the pupal
stage is no longer than in the summer form, viz.
fourteen <span class="locked">days.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span> A similar thing occurs with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
<i>A. Levana</i>, for, as already explained, not only
may the development of the winter form be forced
to a certain degree by artificial warmth, but the
summer generation frequently produces reversion-forms
without protraction of development. The
intermediate reversion-form <i>Porima</i> was known
long before it was thought possible that it could
be produced artificially by the action of cold;
it appears occasionally, although very rarely, at
midsummer in the natural state.</p>

<p>If, then, my explanation of the phenomena is
correct, the winter form is primary and the
summer the secondary form, and those individuals
which, naturally or artificially, assume the winter
form must be considered as cases of atavism. The
suggestion thus arises whether low temperature
alone is competent to bring about this reversion,
or whether other external influences are not also
effective. Indeed, the latter appears to be the
case. Besides purely internal causes, as previously
pointed out in <i>P. Ajax</i>, warmth and mechanical
motion appear to be able to bring about reversion.</p>

<p>That an unusually high temperature may cause
reversion, I conclude from the following observation.
In the summer of 1869 I bred the first
summer brood of <i>A. Levana</i>; the caterpillars
pupated during the second half of June, and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
that time to their emergence, on 28th June&ndash;3rd
July, great heat prevailed. Now, while the intermediate
form <i>Porima</i> had hitherto been a great
rarity, both in the free state and when bred, having
never obtained it myself, for example, out of many
hundreds of specimens, there were among the
sixty or seventy butterflies that emerged from the
above brood, some eight to ten examples of
<i>Porima</i>. This is certainly not an exact experiment,
but there seems to me a certain amount of
probability that the high summer temperature in
this case brought about reversion.</p>

<p>Neither for the second cause to which I have
ascribed the power of producing reversion can I
produce any absolute evidence, since the experimental
solution of all these collateral questions
would demand an endless amount of time. I am
in possession of an observation, however, which
makes it appear probable to me that continuous
mechanical movement acts on the development of
the pupæ in a similar manner to cold, that is,
retarding them, and at the same time producing
reversion. I had, in Freiburg, a large number of
pupæ of the first summer brood of <i>Pieris Napi</i>,
bred from eggs. I changed residence while many
caterpillars were in course of transformation and
travelled with the pupæ in this state seven hours
by rail. Although this brood of <i>P. Napi</i>, under
ordinary circumstances, always emerges in the
summer, generally in July of the same year, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
summer form (var. <i>Napeæ</i>), yet out of these
numerous pupæ I did not get a single butterfly
during the year 1872. In winter I kept them in
a warm room, and the first butterflies emerged in
January, 1873, the remainder following in February,
March, and April, and two females not
until June. All appeared, however, as exquisite
winter forms. The whole course of development
was precisely as though cold had acted on the
pupæ; and in fact, I could find no other cause for
this quite exceptional deportment than the seven
hours’ shaking to which the pupæ were exposed
by the railway journey, immediately after or during
their transformation.</p>

<p>It is obviously a fact of fundamental importance
to the theory of seasonal dimorphism, that the
summer form can be readily changed into the
winter form, whilst the latter cannot be changed
into the summer form. I have thus far only made
experiments on this subject with <i>A. Levana</i>, but
the same fact appears to me to obtain for <i>P. Napi</i>.
I did not, however, operate upon the ordinary
winter form of <i>P. Napi</i>, but chose for this experiment
the variety <i>Bryoniæ</i>, well known to all entomologists.
This is, to a certain extent, the potential
winter form of <i>P. Napi</i>; the male (Fig. 14,
<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>.) exactly resembles the ordinary winter
form in the most minute detail, but the female is
distinguished from <i>Napi</i> by a sprinkling of greyish
brown scales over the whole of the upper side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
the wings (Fig. 15, <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>.). This type, <i>Bryoniæ</i>,
occurs in Polar regions as the only form of <i>Napi</i>,
and is also found in the higher Alps, where it flies
in secluded meadows as the only form, but in other
localities, less isolated, mixed with the ordinary
form of the species. In both regions <i>Bryoniæ</i>
produces but one generation in the year, and must
thus, according to my theory, be regarded as the
parent-form of <i>Pieris Napi</i>.</p>

<p>If this hypothesis is correct&mdash;if the variety
<i>Bryoniæ</i> is really the original form preserved from
the glacial period in certain regions of the earth,
whilst <i>Napi</i> in its winter form is the first secondary
form gradually produced through a warm climate,
then it would be impossible ever to breed the
ordinary form <i>Napi</i> from pupæ of <i>Bryoniæ</i> by
the action of warmth, since the form of the species
now predominant must have come into existence
only by a cumulative action exerted on numerous
generations, and not <i>per saltum</i>.</p>

<p>The experiment was made in the following
manner: In the first part of June I caught a
female of <i>Bryoniæ</i> in a secluded Alpine valley,
and placed her in a capacious breeding-cage, where
she flew about among the flowers, and laid more
than a hundred eggs on the ordinary cabbage.
Although the caterpillars in the free state feed upon
another plant unknown to me, they readily ate the
cabbage, grew rapidly, and pupated at the end of
July. I then brought the pupæ into a hothouse in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
which the temperature fluctuated between 12°
and 24° R.; but, in spite of this high temperature,
and&mdash;what is certainly of more special importance&mdash;notwithstanding
the want of cooling at night, only
one butterfly emerged the same summer, and
that a male, which, from certain minute characteristic
markings, could be safely identified as var.
<i>Bryoniæ</i>. The other pupæ hibernated in the
heated room, and produced, from the end of
January to the beginning of June, 28 butterflies,
all of which were exquisite <i>Bryoniæ</i>.</p>

<p>Experiment thus confirmed the view that
<i>Bryoniæ</i> is the parent-form of <i>Napi</i>, and the
description hitherto given by systematists ought
therefore properly to be reversed. <i>Pieris Bryoniæ</i>
should be elevated to the rank of a species, and
the ordinary winter and summer forms should be
designated as vars. <i>Napi</i> and <i>Napeæ</i>. Still I
should not like to take it upon myself to increase
the endless confusion in the synonomy of butterflies.
In a certain sense, it is also quite correct to
describe the form <i>Bryoniæ</i> as a climatic variety, for
it is, in fact, established, if not produced, by climate,
by which agency it is likewise preserved; only it
is not a secondary, but the primary, climatic variety
of <i>Napi</i>. In this sense most species might probably
be described as climatic varieties, inasmuch
as under the influence of another climate they
would gradually acquire new characters, whilst,
under the influence of the climate now prevailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
in their habitats, they have, to a certain extent,
acquired and preserved their present form.</p>

<p>The var. <i>Bryoniæ</i> is, however, of quite special
interest, since it makes clear the relation which
exists between climatic variation and seasonal
dimorphism, as will be proved in the next section.
The correctness of the present theory must first
here be submitted to further proof.</p>

<p>It has been shown that the secondary forms of
seasonally dimorphic butterflies do not all possess
the tendency to revert in the same degree, but that
this tendency rather varies with each individual.
As the return to the primary form is synonymous
with the relinquishing of the secondary, the greater
tendency to revert is thus synonymous with the
greater tendency to relinquish the secondary form,
but this again is equivalent to a lesser stability of
the latter; it must consequently be concluded that
the individuals of a species are very differently
influenced by climatic change, so that with some
the new form must become sooner established than
with others. From this a variability of the generation
concerned must necessarily ensue, i.e., the
individuals of the summer generation must differ
more in colour and marking than is the case with
those of the winter generation. If the theory is
correct, the summer generations should be more
variable than the winter generations&mdash;at least, so
long as the greatest possible equalization of individual
variations has not occurred through the
continued action of warmth, combined with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
constant crossing of individuals which have become
changed in different degrees. Here also
the theory is fully in accord with facts.</p>

<p>In <i>A. Levana</i> the <i>Levana</i> form is decidedly
more constant than the <i>Prorsa</i> form. The first is,
to a slight extent, sexually dimorphic, the female
being light and the male dark-coloured. If we take
into consideration this difference between the sexes,
which also occurs to a still smaller extent in the
<i>Prorsa</i> form, the foregoing statement will be found
correct, viz. that the <i>Levana</i> form varies but little,
and in all cases considerably less than the <i>Prorsa</i>
form, in which the greatest differences occur in
the yellow stripes and in the disappearance of the
black spots on the white band of the hind wing,
these black spots being persistent <i>Levana</i> markings.
It is, in fact, difficult to find two perfectly
similar individuals of the <i>Prorsa</i> form. It must,
moreover, be considered that the <i>Levana</i> marking,
being the more complicated, would the more
readily show variation. Precisely the same thing
occurs in <i>Pieris Napi</i>, in which also the var.
<i>Æstiva</i> is considerably more variable than the
var. <i>Vernalis</i>. From the behaviour of the var.
<i>Bryoniæ</i>, on the other hand, which I regard as the
parent-form, one might be tempted to raise an
objection to the theory; for this form is well
known to be extraordinarily variable in colour
and marking, both in the Alps and Jura, where it
is met with at the greatest altitudes. According
to the theory, <i>Bryoniæ</i> should be less variable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
than the winter form of the lowlands, because it is
the older, and should therefore be the more constant
in its characters. It must not be forgotten,
however, that the variability of a species may not
only originate in the one familiar manner of unequal
response of the individual to the action of
varying exciting causes, but also by the crossing of
two varieties separately established in adjacent
districts and subsequently brought into contact.
In the Alps and Jura the ordinary form of <i>Napi</i>
swarms everywhere from the plains towards the
habitats of <i>Bryoniæ</i>, so that a crossing of the two
forms may occasionally, or even frequently, take
place; and it is not astonishing if in some places
(Meiringen, for example) a perfect series of intermediate
forms between <i>Napi</i> and <i>Bryoniæ</i> is met
with. That crossing is the cause of the great
variability of <i>Bryoniæ</i> in the Alpine districts, is
proved by the fact that in the Polar regions this
form “is by no means so variable as in the Alps,
but, judging from about forty to fifty Norwegian
specimens, is rather constant.” My friend, Dr.
Staudinger, who has twice spent the summer in
Lapland, thus writes in reply to my question.
A crossing with <i>Napi</i> cannot there take place,
as this form is never met with, so that the ancient
parent-form <i>Bryoniæ</i> has been able to preserve its
original constancy. In this case also the facts
thus accord with the requirements of the theory.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h4 id="P1-2">II.<br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Seasonal Dimorphism and Climatic
Variation.</span></span></h4>

<p>If, as I have attempted to show, seasonal dimorphism
originates through the slow operation of a
changed summer climate, then is this phenomenon
nothing else than the splitting up of a species into
two climatic varieties in the same district, and we
may expect to find various connexions between
ordinary simple climatic variation and seasonal
dimorphism. Cases indeed occur in which seasonal
dimorphism and climatic variation pass into
each other, and are interwoven in such a manner
that the insight into the origin and nature of
seasonal dimorphism gained experimentally finds
confirmation. Before I go more closely into this
subject, however, it is necessary to come to an
understanding as to the conception “climatic
variation,” for this term is often very arbitrarily
applied to quite dissimilar phenomena.</p>

<p>According to my view there should be a sharp
distinction made between climatic and local
varieties. The former should comprehend only
such cases as originate through the direct action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
of climatic influences; while under the general
designation of “local forms,” should be comprised
all variations which have their origin in other
causes&mdash;such, for example, as in the indirect action
of the external conditions of life, or in circumstances
which do not owe their present existence
to climate and external conditions, but rather to
those geological changes which produce isolation.
Thus, for instance, ancient species elsewhere long
extinct might be preserved in certain parts of the
earth by the protecting influence of isolation,
whilst others which immigrated in a state of
variability might become transformed into local
varieties in such regions through the action of
<span class="locked">‘amixia,’<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span> i.e. by not being allowed to cross with
their companion forms existing in the other
portions of their habitat. In single cases it may
be difficult, or for the present impossible, to decide
whether we have before us a climatic form, or a
local form arising from other causes; but for this
very reason we should be cautious in defining
climatic variation.</p>

<p>The statement that climatic forms, in the true
sense of the word, do exist is well known to me,
and has been made unhesitatingly by all zoologists;
indeed, a number of authentically observed facts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>might be produced, which prove that quite constant
changes in a species may be brought about by the
direct action of changed climatic conditions. With
butterflies it is in many cases possible to separate
pure climatic varieties from other local forms, inasmuch
as we are dealing with only unimportant
changes and not with those of biological value, so
that natural selection may at the outset be excluded
as the cause of the changes in question.
Then again the sharply defined geographical
distribution climatically governed, often furnishes
evidence of transition forms in districts lying
between two climatic extremes.</p>

<p>In the following attempt to make clear the
relationship between simple climatic variation and
seasonal dimorphism, I shall concern myself only
with such undoubted climatic varieties. A case
of this kind, in which the winter form of a
seasonally dimorphic butterfly occurs in other
habitats as the only form, i.e., as a climatic variety,
has already been adduced in a former paragraph.
I allude to the case of <i>Pieris Napi</i>, the winter
form of which seasonally dimorphic species occurs
in the temperate plains of Europe, whilst in Lapland
and the Alps it is commonly found as a
monomorphic climatic variety which is a higher
development of the winter type, viz., the var.
<i>Bryoniæ</i>.</p>

<p>Very analogous is the case of <i>Euchloe Belia</i>,
a butterfly likewise belonging to the <i>Pierinæ</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
which extends from the Mediterranean countries
to the middle of France, and everywhere manifests
a very sharply pronounced seasonal dimorphism.
Its summer form was, until quite recently,
described as a distinct species, <i>E. Ausonia</i>. Staudinger
was the first to prove by breeding that the
supposed two species were genetically <span class="locked">related.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span>
This species, in addition to being found in the
countries named, occurs also at a little spot
in the Alps in the neighbourhood of the Simplon
Pass. Owing to the short summer of the Alpine
climate the species has in this locality but one
annual brood, which bears the characters of the
winter form, modified in all cases by the coarser
thickly scattered hairs of the body (peculiar to
many Alpine butterflies,) and some other slight
differences. The var. <i>Simplonia</i> is thus in the
Alps a simple climatic variety, whilst in the plains
of Spain and the South of France it appears as
the winter form of a seasonally dimorphic species.</p>

<p>This <i>Euchloe</i> var. <i>Simplonia</i> obviously corresponds
to the var. <i>Bryoniæ</i> of <i>Pieris Napi</i>, and it
is highly probable that this form of <i>E. Belia</i>
must likewise be regarded as the parent-form of
the species surviving from the glacial epoch,
although it cannot be asserted, as can be done in
the case of <i>Bryoniæ</i>, that the type has undergone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
no change since that epoch, for <i>Bryoniæ</i> from
Lapland is identical with the Alpine <span class="locked">form,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></span> whilst
<i>E. Simplonia</i> does not appear to occur in Polar
countries.</p>

<p>Very interesting also is the case of <i>Polyommatus
Phlæas</i>, Linn., one of our commonest <i>Lycænidæ</i>,
which has a very wide distribution, extending from
Lapland to Spain and <span class="locked">Sicily.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span> If we compare
specimens of this beautiful copper-coloured butterfly
from Lapland with those from Germany, no
constant difference can be detected; the insect
has, however, but one annual generation in Lapland,
whilst in Germany it is double-brooded; but the
winter and summer generations resemble each
other completely, and specimens which had been
caught in spring on the Ligurian coast were likewise
similarly coloured to those from Sardinia. (Fig. 21,
<a href="#Plate_II">Plate II</a>.). According to these facts we might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
believe this species to be extraordinarily indifferent
to climatic influence; but the South European
summer generation differs to a not inconsiderable
extent from the winter generation just mentioned,
the brilliant coppery lustre being nearly covered
with a thick sprinkling of black scales. (<a href="#Plate_II">Plate II</a>.,
Fig. 22.) The species has thus become seasonally
dimorphic under the influence of the warm
southern climate, although this is not the case in
Germany where it also has two generations in
the <span class="locked">year.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></span> No one who is acquainted only with
the Sardinian summer form, and not with the
winter form of that place, would hesitate to regard
the former as a climatic variety of our <i>P. Phlæas</i>;
or, conversely, the north German form as a
climatic variety of the southern summer form&mdash;according
as he accepts the one or the other as
the primary form of the species.</p>

<p>Still more complex are the conditions in another
species of <i>Lycænidæ</i>, <i>Plebeius Agestis</i> (= <i>Alexis</i>
Scop.), which presents a double seasonal dimorphism.
This butterfly appears in three forms; in
Germany A and B alternate with each other as
winter and summer forms, whilst in Italy B and
C succeed each other as winter and summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
forms. The form B thus occurs in both climates,
appearing as the summer form in Germany and
as the winter form in Italy. The German winter
variety A, is entirely absent in Italy (as I know
from numerous specimens which I have caught),
whilst the Italian summer form, on the other hand,
(var. <i>Allous</i>, Gerh.), does not occur in Germany.
The distinctions between the three forms are
sufficiently striking. The form A (Fig. 18, <a href="#Plate_II">Plate
II</a>.) is blackish-brown on the upper side, and has
in the most strongly marked specimens only a trace
of narrow red spots round the borders; whilst the
form B (Fig. 19, <a href="#Plate_II">Plate II</a>.) is ornamented with vivid
red border spots; and C (Fig. 20, <a href="#Plate_II">Plate II</a>.) is distinguished
from B by the strong yellowish-brown
of the under side. If we had before us only the
German winter and the Italian summer forms, we
should, without doubt, regard them as climatic
varieties; but they are connected by the form B,
interpolated in the course of the development of
both, and the two extremes thus maintain the
character of mere seasonal forms.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h4 id="P1-3">III.<br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Nature of the Causes producing Climatic
Varieties.</span></span></h4>

<p>It has been shown that the phenomenon of seasonal
dimorphism has the same proximate cause
as climatic variation, viz. change of climate, and
that it must be regarded as identical in nature
with climatic variation, being distinguished from
ordinary, or, as I have designated it, simple (monomorphic)
climatic variation by the fact that, besides
the new form produced by change of climate,
the old form continues to exist in genetic connexion
with it, so that old and new forms alternate
with each other according to the season.</p>

<p>Two further questions now present themselves
for investigation, viz. (1) by what means does
change of climate induce a change in the marking
and colouring of a butterfly? and (2) to what extent
does the climatic action determine the nature
of the change?</p>

<p>With regard to the former question, it must, in
the first place, be decided whether the true effect of
climatic change lies in the action of a high or low
temperature on the organism, or whether it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
not perhaps be produced by the accelerated development
caused by a high temperature, and the
retarded development caused by a low temperature.
Other factors belonging to the category of external
conditions of life which are included in the term
“climate” may be disregarded, as they are of no
importance in these cases. The question under
consideration is difficult to decide, since, on the one
hand, warmth and a short pupal period, and, on
the other hand, cold and a long pupal period, are
generally inseparably connected with each other;
and without great caution one may easily be led
into fallacies, by attributing to the influence of
causes now acting that which is but the consequence
of long inheritance.</p>

<p>When, in the case of <i>Araschnia Levana</i>, even
in very cold summers, <i>Prorsa</i>, but never the <i>Levana</i>
form, emerges, it would still be erroneous to
conclude that it is only the shorter period of development
of the winter generation, and not the
summer warmth, which occasioned the formation
of the <i>Prorsa</i> type. This new form of the species
did not come suddenly into existence, but (as appears
sufficiently from the foregoing experiments)
originated in the course of many generations, during
which summer warmth and a short development
period were generally associated together. From
the fact that the winter generation always produces
<i>Levana</i>, even when the pupæ have not been exposed
to cold but kept in a room, it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
equally erroneous to infer that the cold of winter
had no influence in determining the type. In this
case also the determining causes must have been in
operation during innumerable generations. After
the winter form of the species has become established
throughout such a long period, it remains
constant, even when the external influence which
produced it (cold) is occasionally withdrawn.</p>

<p>Experiments cannot further assist us here, since
we cannot observe throughout long periods of time;
but there are certain observations, which to me
appear decisive. When, both in Germany and
Italy, we see <i>Polyommatus Phlæas</i> appearing in
two generations, of which both the German ones
are alike, whilst in Italy the summer brood is
black, we cannot ascribe this fact to the influence
of a shorter period of development, because this
period is the same both in Germany and Italy
(two annual generations), so that it can only be
attributed to the higher temperature of summer.</p>

<p>Many similar cases might be adduced, but the
one given suffices for proof. I am therefore of
opinion that it is not the duration of the period of
development which is the cause of change in the
formation of climatic varieties of butterflies, but
only the temperature to which the species is exposed
during its pupal existence. In what manner,
then, are we to conceive that warmth acts on the
marking and colouring of a butterfly? This is a
question which could only be completely answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
by gaining an insight into the mysterious chemico-physiological
processes by which the butterfly is
formed in the chrysalis; and indeed only by such
a complete insight into the most minute details,
which are far beyond our scrutiny, could we arrive
at, or even approximate to, an explanation of the
development of any living organism. Nevertheless
an important step can be taken towards the
solution of this problem, by establishing that the
change does not depend essentially upon the
action of warmth, but upon the organism itself,
as appears from the nature of the change in one
and the same species.</p>

<p>If we compare the Italian summer form of <i>Polyommatus
Phlæas</i> with its winter form, we shall find
that the difference between them consists only in
the brilliant coppery red colour of the latter being
largely suffused in the summer form with black
scales. When entomologists speak of a “black
dusting” of the upper side of the wings, this statement
must not of course be understood literally;
the number of scales is the same in both forms,
but in the summer variety they are mostly black,
a comparatively small number being red. We
might thus be inclined to infer that, owing to the
high temperature, the chemistry of the material
undergoing transformation in <i>Phlæas</i> is changed
in such a manner that less red and more black
pigment is produced. But the case is not so
simple, as will appear evident when we consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
the fact that the summer forms have not originated
suddenly, but only in the course of numerous generations;
and when we further compare the two
seasonal forms in other species. Thus in <i>Pieris
Napi</i> the winter is distinguished from the summer
form, among other characters, by the strong black
dusting of the base of the wings. But we cannot
conclude from this that in the present case more
black pigment is produced in the winter than in the
summer form, for in the latter, although the base of
the wings is white, their tips and the black spots
on the fore-wings are larger and of a deeper black
than in the winter form. The quantity of black
pigment produced does not distinguish between
the two forms, but the mode of its distribution
upon the wings.</p>

<p>Even in the case of species the summer form of
which really possesses far more black than the
winter form, as, for instance, <i>Araschnia Levana</i>,
one type cannot be derived from the other simply
by the expansion of the black spots present, since
on the same place where in <i>Levana</i> a black band
crosses the wings, <i>Prorsa</i>, which otherwise possesses
much more black, has a white line. (See
Figs. 1&ndash;9, <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>.) The intermediate forms which
have been artificially produced by the action of
cold on the summer generation present a graduated
series, according as reversion is more or less complete;
a black spot first appearing in the middle of
the white band of <i>Prorsa</i>, and then becoming enlarged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
until, finally, in the perfect <i>Levana</i> it unites
with another black triangle proceeding from the
front of the band, and thus becomes fused into a
black bar. The white band of <i>Prorsa</i> and the black
band of <i>Levana</i> by no means correspond in position;
in <i>Prorsa</i> quite a new pattern appears, which does
not originate by a simple colour replacement of the
<i>Levana</i> marking. In the present case, therefore,
there is no doubt that the new form is not produced
simply because a certain pigment (black) is formed
in larger quantities, but because its mode of distribution
is at the same time different, white appearing
in some instances where black formerly existed,
whilst in other cases the black remains. Whoever
compares <i>Prorsa</i> with <i>Levana</i> will not fail to be
struck with the remarkable change of marking produced
by the direct action of external conditions.</p>

<p>The numerous intermediate forms which can be
produced artificially appear to me to furnish a further
proof of the gradual character of the transformation.
Ancestral intermediate forms can only
occur where they have once had a former existence
in the phyletic series. Reversion may only
take place completely in some particular characters,
whilst in others the new form remains constant&mdash;this
is in fact the ordinary form of reversion, and
in this manner a mixture of characters might appear
which never existed as a phyletic stage; but
particular characters could certainly never appear
unless they were normal to the species at some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
stage of phyletic development. Were this possible
it would directly contradict the idea of reversion,
according to which new characters never make their
appearance, but only such as have already existed.
If, therefore, the ancestral forms of <i>A. Levana</i>
(which we designate as <i>Porima</i>) present a great
number of transitional varieties, this leads to the
conclusion that the species must have gone through
a long series of stages of phyletic development
before the summer generation had completely
changed into <i>Prorsa</i>. The view of the slow cumulative
action of climatic influences already submitted,
is thus confirmed.</p>

<p>If warmth is thus without doubt the agency which
has gradually changed the colour and marking of
many of our butterflies, it sufficiently appears from
what has just been said concerning the nature of
the change that the chief part in the transmutation
is not to be attributed to the agency in question,
but to the organism which is affected by it. Induced
by warmth, there begins a change in the
ultimate processes of the matter undergoing transformation,
which increases from generation to
generation, and which not only consists in the
appearance of the colouring matter in one place
instead of another, but also in the replacement of
yellow, in one place by white and in another by
black, or in the transformation of black into white
on some portions of the wings, whilst in others
black remains. When we consider with what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
extreme fidelity the most insignificant details of
marking are, in constant species of butterflies,
transmitted from generation to generation, a total
change of the kind under consideration cannot but
appear surprising, and we should not explain it by
the nature of the agency (warmth), but only by the
nature of the species affected. The latter cannot
react upon the warmth in the same manner that a
solution of an iron salt reacts upon potassium ferrocyanide
or upon sulphuretted hydrogen; the
colouring matter of the butterfly’s wing which was
previously black does not become blue or yellow,
nor does that which was white become changed
into black, but a new marking is developed from
the existing one&mdash;or, as I may express it in more
general terms, the species takes another course of
development; the complicated chemico-physical
processes in the matter composing the pupa become
gradually modified in such a manner that,
as the final result, a new marking and colouring
of the butterfly is produced.</p>

<p>Further facts can be adduced in support of the
view that in these processes it is the constitution
of the species, and not the external agency
(warmth), which plays the chief part. The latter,
as Darwin has strikingly expressed it, rather performs
the function of the spark which ignites a
combustible substance, whilst the character of the
combustion depends upon the nature of the explosive
material. Were this not the case, increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
warmth would always change a given <span class="locked">colour<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span> in the
same manner in all butterflies, and would therefore
always give rise to the production of the same
colour. But this does not occur; <i>Polyommatus
Phlæas</i>, for example, becoming black in the south,
whilst the red-brown <i>Vanessa Urticæ</i> becomes black
in high northern latitudes, and many other cases
well known to entomologists might be <span class="locked">adduced.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></span>
It indeed appears that species of similar physical
constitution, i.e., nearly allied species, under similar
climatic influences, change in an analogous manner.
A beautiful example of this is furnished
by our <i>Pierinæ</i>. Most of the species display
seasonal dimorphism; as, for instance, <i>Pieris
Brassicæ</i>, <i>Rapæ</i>, <i>Napi</i>, <i>Krueperi</i>, and <i>Daplidice</i>,
<i>Euchloe Belia</i> and <i>Belemia</i>, and <i>Leucophasia
Sinapis</i>, in all of which the difference between the
winter and the summer forms is of a precisely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
similar nature. The former are characterized by
a strong black dusting of the base of the wings,
and by a blackish or green sprinkling of scales on
the underside of the hind wings, while the latter
have intensely black tips to the wings, and frequently
also spots on the fore-wings.</p>

<p>Nothing can prove more strikingly, however,
that in such cases everything depends upon the
physical constitution, than the fact that in the same
species the males become changed in a different
manner to the females. The parent-form of <i>Pieris
Napi</i> (var. <i>Bryoniæ</i>) offers an example. In all
the <i>Pierinæ</i> secondary sexual differences are found,
the males being differently marked to the females;
the species are thus sexually dimorphic. Now the
male of the Alpine and Polar var. <i>Bryoniæ</i>, which
I conceive to be the ancestral form, is scarcely to
be distinguished, as has already been mentioned,
from the male of our German winter form (<i>P.
Napi</i>, var. <i>Vernalis</i>), whilst the female differs <span class="locked">considerably.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span>
The gradual climatic change which
transformed the parent-form <i>Bryoniæ</i> into <i>Napi</i>
has therefore exerted a much greater effect on the
female than on the male. The external action on
the two sexes was exactly the same, but the response
of the organism was different, and the
cause of the difference can only be sought for in
the fine differences of physical constitution which
distinguish the male from the female. If we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
unable to define these differences precisely, we may
nevertheless safely conclude from such observations
that they exist.</p>

<p>I have given special prominence to this subject
because, in my idea, Darwin ascribes too much
power to sexual selection when he attributes the
formation of secondary sexual characters to the
sole action of this agency. The case of <i>Bryoniæ</i>
teaches us that such characters may arise from
purely innate causes; and until experiments have
decided how far the influence of sexual selection
extends, we are justified in believing that the sexual
dimorphism of butterflies is due in great part to
the differences of physical constitution between
the sexes. It is quite different with such sexual
characters as the stridulating organs of male Orthoptera
which are of undoubted importance to
that sex. These can certainly be attributed with
great probability to sexual selection.</p>

<p>It may perhaps not be superfluous to adduce
one more similar case, in which, however, the male
and not the female is the most affected by climate.
In our latitudes, as also in the extreme north,
<i>Polyommatus Phlæas</i>, already so often mentioned,
is perfectly similar in both sexes in colour and
marking; and the same holds good for the winter
generation of the south. The summer generation of
the latter, however, exhibits a slight sexual dimorphism,
the red of the fore wings of the female being
less completely covered with black than in the male.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Why all Polygoneutic Species are not
Seasonally Dimorphic.</span></span></h4>

<p>If we may consider it to be established that
seasonal dimorphism is nothing else than the
splitting up of a species into two climatic varieties
in one and the same locality, the further question
at once arises why all polygoneutic species
(those which produce more than <i>one</i> annual generation)
are not seasonally dimorphic.</p>

<p>To answer this, it will be necessary to go more
deeply into the development of seasonal dimorphism.
This evidently depends upon a peculiar
kind of periodic, alternating heredity, which we
might be tempted to identify with Darwin’s
“inheritance at corresponding periods of life.”
It does not, however, in any way completely
agree with this principle, although it presents a
great analogy to it and must depend ultimately
upon the same cause. The Darwinian “inheritance
at corresponding periods of life”&mdash;or, as it
is termed by Haeckel, “homochronic heredity”&mdash;is
characterized by the fact that new characters
always appear in the individuals at the same stage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
of life as that in which they appeared in their progenitors.
The truth of this principle has been
firmly established, instances being known in which
both the first appearance of a new (especially
pathological) character and its transmission through
several generations has been observed. Seasonally
dimorphic butterflies also furnish a further valuable
proof of this principle, since they show that not
only variations which arise suddenly (and which
are therefore probably due to purely innate causes)
follow this mode of inheritance, but also that characters
gradually called forth by the influence of
external conditions and accumulating from generation
to generation, are only inherited at that period
of life in which these conditions were or are effective.
In all seasonally dimorphic butterflies which
I have been able to examine closely, I found the
caterpillars of the summer and winter broods to be
perfectly identical. The influences which, by
acting on the pupæ, split up the imagines into
two climatic forms, were thus without effect on
the earlier stages of development. I may specially
mention that the caterpillars, as well as the pupæ
and eggs of <i>A. Levana</i>, are perfectly alike both in
the summer and winter forms; and the same is the
case in the corresponding stages of <i>P. Napi</i> and
<i>P. Bryoniæ</i>.</p>

<p>I shall not here attempt to enter more deeply
into the nature of the phenomena of inheritance.
It is sufficient to have confirmed the law that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
influences which act only on certain stages in the
development of the individual, even when the
action is cumulative and not sudden, only affect
those particular stages without having any effect
on the earlier or later stages. This law is
obviously of the greatest importance to the comprehension
of metamorphosis. <span class="locked">Lubbock<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span> has
briefly shown in a very clear manner how the
existence of metamorphosis in insects can be
explained by the indirect action of varying conditions
on the different life-stages of a species.
Thus the mandibles of a caterpillar are, by adaptation
to another mode of nourishment, exchanged
at a later period of life for a suctorial organ. Such
adaptation of the various development-stages of a
species to the different conditions of life would
never give rise to metamorphosis, if the law of
homochronic, or periodic, heredity did not cause
the characters gradually acquired at a given stage
to be transferred to the same stage of the following
generation.</p>

<p>The origin of seasonal dimorphism depends
upon a very similar law, or rather form, of inheritance,
which differs from that above considered
only in the fact that, instead of the ontogenetic
stages, a whole series of generations is influenced.
This form of inheritance may be formulated somewhat
as follows:&mdash;When dissimilar conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
alternatingly influence a series of generations, a
cycle is produced in which the changes are
transmitted only to those generations which are
acted upon by corresponding conditions, and not
to the intermediate ones. Characters which have
arisen by the action of a summer climate are inherited
by the summer generation only, whilst they
remain latent in the winter generation. It is the
same as with the mandibles of a caterpillar which
are latent in the butterfly, and again make their
appearance in the corresponding (larval) stage of
the succeeding generation. This is not mere
hypothesis, but the legitimate inference from the
facts. If it be admitted that my conception of
seasonal dimorphism as a double climatic variation
is correct, the law of “cyclical <span class="locked">heredity,”<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span> as I may
term it&mdash;in contradistinction to “homochronic
heredity,” which relates only to the ontogenetic
stages&mdash;immediately follows. All those cases
which come under the designation of ‘alternation
of generation,’ can obviously be referred to cyclical
heredity, as will be explained further on. In the
one case the successive generations deport themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
exactly in the same manner as do the
successive stages of development of the individual
in the other; and we may conclude therefrom (as
has long been admitted on other grounds) that a
generation is, in fact, nothing else than a stage of
development in the life of a species. This appears
to me to furnish a beautiful confirmation of the
theory of descent.</p>

<p>Now if, returning to questions previously solved,
the alternating action of cold in winter and warmth
in summer leads to the production of a winter and
summer form, according to the law of cyclical heredity,
the question still remains: why do we not
find seasonal dimorphism in all polygoneutic
butterflies?</p>

<p>We might at first suppose that all species are
not equally sensitive to the influence of temperature:
indeed, the various amounts of difference
between the winter and summer forms in different
species would certainly show the existence of
different degrees of sensitiveness to the modifying
action of temperature. But even this does not
furnish an explanation, since there are butterflies
which produce two perfectly <span class="locked">similar<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span> generations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
wherever they occur, and which, nevertheless,
appear in different climates as climatic varieties.
This is the case with <i>Pararga Ægeria</i> (Fig. 23,
<a href="#Plate_II">Plate II</a>.), the southern variety of which, <i>Meione</i>
(Fig. 24, <a href="#Plate_II">Plate II</a>.), is connected with it by an
intermediate form from the Ligurian coast. This
species possesses, therefore, a decided power of
responding to the influence of temperature, and
yet no distinction has taken place between the
summer and the winter form. We can thus
only attribute this different deportment to a
different kind of heredity; and we may therefore
plainly state, that changes produced by alternation
of climate are not always inherited <i>alternatingly</i>,
i.e. by the corresponding generations, but sometimes
<i>continuously</i>, appearing in every generation,
and never remaining latent. The causes which
determine why, in a particular case, the one
or the other form of inheritance prevails, can
be only innate, i.e. they lie in the organism
itself, and there is as little to be said upon
their precise nature as upon that of any other
process of heredity. In a similar manner Darwin
admits a kind of double inheritance with respect
to characters produced by sexual selection; in
one form these characters remain limited to the
sex which first acquired them, in the other form
they are inherited by both sexes, without it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
being apparent why, in any particular case, the
one or the other form of heredity should take
place.</p>

<p>The foregoing explanation may obtain in the
case of sexual selection, in which it is not inconceivable
that certain characters may not be so
easily produced, or even not produced at all,
in one sex, owing to its differing from the other
in physical constitution. In the class of cases
under consideration, however, it is not possible
that the inherited characters can be prevented
from being acquired by one generation owing
to its physical constitution, since this constitution
was similar in all the successive generations before
the appearance of dimorphism. The constitution
in question first became dissimilar in the two
generations to the extent of producing a change
of specific character, through the action of temperature
on the alternating broods of each year,
combined with cyclical heredity. If the law
of cyclical heredity be a general one, it must
hold good for all cases, and characters acquired
by the summer generation could never have been
also transmitted to the winter generation from
the very first.</p>

<p>I will not deny the possibility that if alternating
heredity should become subsequently entirely suppressed
throughout numerous generations, a period
may arrive when the preponderating influence of
a long series of summer generations may ultimately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
take effect upon the winter generation. In
such a case the summer characters would appear,
instead of remaining latent as formerly. In this
manner it may be imagined that at first but few,
and later more numerous individuals, approximate
to the summer form, until finally the dimorphism
entirely disappears, the new form thus gaining
ascendency and the species becoming once more
monomorphic. Such a supposition is indeed
capable of being supported by some facts, an
observation on <i>A. Levana</i> apparently contradicting
the theory having been already interpreted
in this sense. I refer to the fact that
whilst some butterflies of the winter generation
emerge in October as <i>Prorsa</i>, others hibernate,
and appear the following spring in the <i>Levana</i>
form. The winter form of <i>Pieris Napi</i> also
no longer preserves, in the female sex, the
striking coloration of the ancestral form <i>Bryoniæ</i>,
a fact which may indicate the influencing of the
winter generation by numerous summer generations.
The double form of the spring generation
of <i>Papilio Ajax</i> can be similarly explained by the
gradual change of alternating into continuous
heredity, as has already been mentioned. All
these cases, however, are perhaps capable of
another interpretation; at any rate, the correctness
of this supposition can only be decided by
further facts.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, even if we suppose the above explanation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
to be correct, it will not apply to the
absence of seasonal dimorphism in cases like that
of <i>Pararga Ægeria</i> and <i>Meione</i>, in which only <i>one</i>
summer generation appears, so that a preponderating
inheritance of summer characters cannot be
admitted. Another explanation must thus be
sought, and I believe that I have found it in the
circumstance that the butterflies named do not
hibernate as pupæ but as caterpillars, so that the
cold of winter does not directly influence those
processes of development by which the perfect
insect is formed in the chrysalis. It is precisely
on this point that the origin of those differences
of colour which we designate as the seasonal
dimorphism of butterflies appears to depend.
Previous experiments give great probability to this
statement. From these we know that the eggs,
caterpillars, and pupæ of all the seasonally dimorphic
species experimented with are perfectly
similar in the summer and winter generations, the
imago stage only showing any difference. We
know further from these experiments, that temperature-influences
which affect the caterpillars
never entail a change in the butterflies; and
finally, that the artificial production of the reversion
of the summer to the winter form can
only be brought about by operating on the pupæ.</p>

<p>Since many monogoneutic species now hibernate
in the caterpillar stage (e.g. <i>Satyrus Proserpina</i>,
and <i>Hermione</i>, <i>Epinephele Eudora</i>, <i>Furtina,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
Ithonus</i>, <i>Hyperanthus</i>, <i>Ida</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>), we may admit
that during the glacial period such species did not
pass the winter as pupæ. As the climate grew
warmer, and in consequence thereof a second
generation became gradually interpolated in many
of these monogoneutic species, there would ensue
(though by no means necessarily) a disturbance of
the winter generation, of such a kind that the
pupæ, instead of the caterpillars as formerly,
would then hibernate. It may, indeed, be easily
proved <i>à priori</i> that whenever a disturbance of
the winter generation takes place it only does so
retrogressively, that is to say&mdash;species which at one
time pass the winter as caterpillars subsequently
hibernate in the egg, while those which formerly
hibernate as pupæ afterwards do so as caterpillars.
The interpolation of a summer generation must
necessarily delay till further towards the end
of summer, the brood about to hibernate; the
remainder of the summer, which serves for the
development of the eggs and young caterpillars,
may possibly under these conditions be insufficient
for pupation, and the species which hibernated
in the pupal state when it was monogoneutic,
may perhaps pass the winter in the larval condition
after the introduction of the second brood.
A disturbance of this kind is conceivable; but it is
certain that many species suffer no further alteration
in their development than that of becoming
digoneutic from monogoneutic. This follows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
from the fact that hibernation takes place in the
caterpillar stage in many species of the sub-family
<i>Satyridæ</i> which are now digoneutic, as well as in
the remaining monogoneutic species of the same
sub-family. But we cannot expect seasonal dimorphism
to appear in all digoneutic butterflies the
winter generation of which hibernates in the
caterpillar form, since the pupal stage in these
species experiences nearly the same influences of
temperature in both generations. We are hence
led to the conclusion that seasonal dimorphism
must arise in butterflies whenever the pupæ of
the alternating annual generations are exposed
throughout long periods of time to widely
different regularly recurring changes of temperature.</p>

<p>The facts agree with this conclusion, inasmuch
as most butterflies which exhibit seasonal dimorphism
hibernate in the pupa stage. Thus, this
is the case with all the <i>Pierinæ</i>, with <i>Papilio
Machaon</i>, <i>P. Podalirius</i>, and <i>P. Ajax</i>, as well as
with <i>Araschnia Levana</i>. Nevertheless, it cannot
be denied that seasonal dimorphism occurs also in
some species which do not hibernate as pupæ but
as caterpillars; as, for instance, in the strongly
dimorphic <i>Plebeius Amyntas</i>. But such cases can
be explained in a different manner.</p>

<p>Again, the formation of a climatic variety&mdash;and
as such must we regard seasonally dimorphic
forms&mdash;by no means entirely depends on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
magnitude of the difference between the temperature
which acts on the pupæ of the primary and
that which acts on those of the secondary form;
it rather depends on the absolute temperature
which the pupæ experience. This follows without
doubt from the fact that many species, such as
our common Swallow-tail (<i>Papilio Machaon</i>), and
also <i>P. Podalirius</i>, in Germany and the rest of
temperate Europe, show no perceptible difference
of colour between the first generation, the pupæ
of which hibernate, and the second generation,
the pupal period of which falls in July, whereas the
same butterflies in South Spain and Italy are to
a small extent seasonally dimorphic. Those
butterflies which are developed under the influence
of a Sicilian summer heat likewise show
climatic variation to a small extent. The following
consideration throws further light on these
conditions. The mean summer and winter temperatures
in Germany differ by about 14.9° R.;
this difference being therefore much more pronounced
than that between the German and
Sicilian summer, which is only about 3.6° R.
Nevertheless, the winter and summer generations
of <i>P. Podalirius</i> are alike in Germany, whilst the
Sicilian summer generation has become a climatic
variety. The cause of this change must therefore
lie in the small difference between the mean
summer temperatures of 15.0° R. (Berlin) and
19.4° R. (Palermo). According to this, a given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
absolute temperature appears to give a tendency
to variation in a certain direction, the necessary
temperature being different for different species.
The latter statement is supported by the facts that,
in the first place, in different species there are
very different degrees of difference between the
summer and winter forms; and secondly, many
digoneutic species are still monomorphic in Germany,
first becoming seasonally dimorphic in
Southern Europe. This is the case with <i>P.
Machaon</i> and <i>P. Podalirius</i>, as already mentioned,
and likewise with <i>Polyommatus Phlæas</i>. Zeller in
1846&ndash;47, during his journey in Italy, recognized
as seasonally dimorphic in a small degree a large
number of diurnal Lepidoptera which are not so
in our <span class="locked">climate.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></span></p>

<p>In a similar manner the appearance of seasonal
dimorphism in species which, like <i>Plebeius Amyntas</i>,
do not hibernate as pupæ, but as caterpillars,
can be simply explained by supposing that the
winter generation was the primary form, and that
the increase in the summer temperature since the
glacial period was sufficient to cause this particular
species to become changed by the gradual
interpolation of a second generation. The dimorphism
of <i>P. Amyntas</i> can, nevertheless, be explained
in another manner. Thus, there may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
have been a disturbance of the period of development
in the manner already indicated, the species
which formerly hibernated in the pupal stage
becoming subsequently disturbed in its course of
development by the interpolation of a summer
generation, and hibernating in consequence in the
caterpillar state. Under these circumstances we
must regard the present winter form (var. <i>Polysperchon</i>)
as having been established under the
influence of a winter climate, this form, since the
supposed disturbance in its development, having
had no reason to become changed, the spring temperature
under which its pupation now takes place
not being sufficiently high. The interpolated
second generation on the other hand, the pupal
period of which falls in the height of summer, may
easily have become formed into a summer variety.</p>

<p>This latter explanation agrees precisely with the
former, both starting with the assumption that in
the present case, as in that of <i>A. Levana</i> and the
<i>Pierinæ</i>, the winter form is the primary one, so
that the dimorphism proceeds from the said winter
form and does not originate the winter but the
summer form, as will be explained. Whether the
winter form has been produced by the action
of the winter or spring temperature is immaterial
in judging single cases, inasmuch as we are not
in a position to state what temperature is necessary
to cause any particular species to become
transformed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
The reverse case is also theoretically conceivable,
viz., that in certain species the summer form
was the primary one, and by spreading northwards
a climate was reached which still permitted the
production of two generations, the pupal stage of
one generation being exposed to the cold of winter,
and thus giving rise to the production of a
secondary winter form. In such a case hibernation
in the pupal state would certainly give rise to
seasonal dimorphism. Whether these conditions
actually occur, appears to me extremely doubtful;
but it may at least be confidently asserted that the
first case is of far more frequent occurrence. The
beautiful researches of Ernst <span class="locked">Hoffmann<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span> furnish
strong evidence for believing that the great
majority of the European butterflies have immigrated,
not from the south, but from Siberia. Of
281 species, 173 have, according to Hoffmann,
come from Siberia, 39 from southern Asia,
and only 8 from Africa, whilst during the
greatest cold of the glacial period, but very few
or possibly no species existed north of the Alps.
Most of the butterflies now found in Europe have
thus, since their immigration, experienced a
gradually increasing warmth. Since seasonal
dimorphism has been developed in some of these
species, the summer form must in all cases have
been the secondary one, as the experiments upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
the reversion of <i>Pieris Napi</i> and <i>Araschnia
Levana</i> have also shown.</p>

<p>All the seasonally dimorphic butterflies known
to me are found in Hoffmann’s list of Siberian
immigrants, with the exception of two species,
viz., <i>Euchloe Belemia</i>, which is cited as an
African immigrant, and <i>Pieris Krueperi</i>, which
may have come through Asia Minor, since at the
present time it has not advanced farther west than
Greece. No considerable change of climate can
be experienced by migrating from east to west,
so that the seasonal dimorphism of <i>Pieris Krueperi</i>
can only depend on a cause similar to that
which affected the Siberian immigrants, that is, the
gradual increase of temperature in the northern
hemisphere since the glacial period. In this
species also, the winter form must be the primary
one. In the case of <i>E. Belemia</i>, on the other
hand, the migration northwards from Africa certainly
indicates removal to a cooler climate,
which may have originated a secondary winter
form, even if nothing more certain can be stated.
We know nothing of the period of migration into
southern Europe; and even migration without
climatic change is conceivable, if it kept pace with
the gradual increase of warmth in the northern
hemisphere since the glacial epoch. Experiments
only would in this case be decisive. If the
summer generation, var. <i>Glauce</i>, were the primary
form, it would not be possible by the action of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
cold on the pupæ of this brood to produce the
winter variety <i>Belemia</i>, whilst, on the other hand,
the pupæ of the winter generation by the influence
of warmth would be made to revert more or less
completely to the form <i>Glauce</i>. It is by no means
to be understood that the species would actually
comport itself in this manner. On the contrary, I
am of opinion that in this case also, the winter
form is primary. The northward migration (from
Africa to south Spain) would be quite insufficient,
and the winter form is now found in Africa as well
as in Spain.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">On Alternation of Generations.</span></span></h4>

<p>Seasonal dimorphism has already been designated
by Wallace as alternation of <span class="locked">generation,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span> a term
which cannot be disputed so long as it is confined
to a regular alternation of dissimilar generations.
But little is gained by this definition, however,
unless it can be proved that both phenomena are
due to similar causes, and that they are consequently
brought about by analogous processes.
The causes of alternation of generation have, until
the present time, been scarcely investigated, owing
to the want of material. Haeckel alone has quite
recently subjected these complicated phenomena
generally to a searching investigation, and has
arrived at the conclusion that the various forms of
metagenesis can be arranged in two series. He
distinguishes a progressive and a retrogressive
series, comprising under the former those species
“which, to a certain extent, are still in a transition
stage from monogenesis to amphigenesis (asexual
to sexual propagation), and the early progenitors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
of which, therefore, never exclusively propagated
themselves sexually” (<i>Trematoda</i>, <i>Hydromedusæ</i>).
Under the other, or retrogressive form of metagenesis,
Haeckel includes a “return from amphigenesis
to monogenesis,” this being the case with
all those species which now manifest a regular
alternation from amphigenesis to parthenogenesis
(<i>Aphides</i>, <i>Rotatoria</i>, <i>Daphniidæ</i>, <i>Phyllopoda</i>, &amp;c.).
Essentially I can but agree entirely with Haeckel.
Simply regarding the phenomena of alternation of
generation as at present known, it appears to me
to be readily admissible that these multiform modes
of propagation must have originated in at least
two different ways, which can be aptly formulated
in the manner suggested by Haeckel.</p>

<p>I will, however, venture to adopt a somewhat
different mode of conception, and regard the manner
of propagation (whether sexual or asexual)
not as the determining, but only as the secondary
cause. I will further hazard the separation of
the phenomena of alternating generations (in their
widest sense) into two main groups according to
their origin, designating the cases of one group as
true metagenesis and those of the other as <span class="locked">heterogenesis.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span>
Metagenesis takes its origin from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
phyletic series of dissimilar forms, whilst heterogenesis
originates from a phyletic series of similar
forms&mdash;this series, so far as we can at present
judge, always consisting of similar sexual generations.
The former would thus nearly coincide
with Haeckel’s progressive, and the latter with his
retrogressive metagenesis. Metagenesis may further
originate in various ways. In the first place,
from metamorphosis, as for example, in the propagation
of the celebrated <i>Cecidomyia</i> with nursing
larvæ. The power which these larvæ possess of
propagating themselves asexually has evidently
been acquired as a secondary character, as appears
from the fact that there are many species of the
same genus the larvæ of which do not nurse, these
larvæ being themselves undoubted secondary forms
produced by the adaptation of this stage of phyletic
development to a mode of life widely different
from that of the later stages. In the form now
possessed by these larvæ they could never have
represented the final stage of their ontogeny, neither
could they have formerly possessed the power
of sexual propagation. The conclusion seems
inevitable that metagenesis has here proceeded
from metamorphosis; that is to say, one stage
of the ontogeny, by acquiring asexual propagation,
has changed the originally existing metamorphosis
into metagenesis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p><span class="locked">Lubbock<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></span> is undoubtedly correct when, for cases
like that just mentioned, he attempts to derive
alternation of generations from metamorphosis.
But if we exclude heterogenesis there still remain
a large number of cases of true metagenesis which
cannot be explained from this point of view.</p>

<p>It must be admitted, with Haeckel, that the
alternation of generations in the Hydromedusæ
and Trematoda does not depend, as in the case of
<i>Cecidomyia</i>, upon the larvæ having acquired the
power of nursing, but that the inferior stages of
these species always possessed this power which
they now only preserve. The nursing Trematode
larvæ now existing may possibly have been formerly
able to propagate themselves also sexually, this
mode of propagation having at the present time
been transferred to a later phyletic stage. In this
case, therefore, metagenesis was not properly produced
by metamorphosis, but arose therefrom in
the course of the phyletic development, the
earlier phyletic stages abandoning the power of
sexual reproduction, and preserving the asexual
mode of propagation. A third way in which
metagenesis might originate is through polymorphosis.
When the latter is combined with
asexual reproduction, as is especially the case
with the Hydrozoa, metagenesis may be derived
therefrom. The successive stages of transformation
of one and the same physiological individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
do not in these cases serve as the point
of departure for alternation of generation, but the
different contemporary forms living gregariously
into which the species has become divided through
functional differentiation of the various individuals
of the same stock. Individuals are here produced
which alone acquire the power of sexual reproduction,
and metagenesis is thus brought about, these
individuals detaching themselves from the stock
on which they originated, while the rest of the
individuals remain in combination, and retain the
asexual mode of propagation. No sharp distinction
can be otherwise drawn between this and the
cases previously <span class="locked">considered.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span> The difference consists
only in the whole cycle of reproduction being
performed by one stock; both classes have the
common character that the different phyletic stages
never appear in the same individual (metamorphosis),
but in the course of further phyletic development
metagenesis at the same time arises,
i.e. the division of these stages among a succession
of individuals. We are therefore able to distinguish
this <i>primary metagenesis</i> from the <i>secondary
metagenesis</i> arising from metamorphosis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
It is not here my intention to enter into the
ultimate causes of metagenesis; in this subject we
should only be able to advance by making vague
hypotheses. The phenomenon of seasonal dimorphism,
with which this work has mainly to deal,
is evidently far removed from metagenesis, and it
was to make this clear that the foregoing observations
were brought forward. The characters common
in the origin of metagenesis are to be found,
according to the views previously set forth, in the
facts that here the faculty of asexual and of sexual
reproduction is always distributed among <i>several</i>
phyletic stages of development which succeed each
other in an ascending series (progressive metagenesis
of Haeckel), whereas I find differences only
in the fact that the power of asexual propagation
may (in metagenesis) be either newly acquired
(larva of <i>Cecidomyia</i>) or preserved from previous
ages (<i>Hydroida</i>). It seems that in this process
sexual reproduction is without exception lost by
the earlier, and remains confined solely to the
most recent stages.</p>

<p>From the investigations on seasonal dimorphism
it appears that a cycle of generations can arise in
an entirely different way. In this case a series of
generations originally alike are made dissimilar by
external influences. This appears to me of the
greatest importance, since seasonal dimorphism is
without doubt closely related to that mode of reproduction
which has hitherto been exclusively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
designated as heterogenesis, and a knowledge of
its mode of origination must therefore throw light
on the nature and origin of heterogenesis in general.</p>

<p>In seasonal dimorphism, as I have attempted to
show, it is the direct action of climate, and indeed
chiefly that of temperature, which brings about the
change in some of the generations. Since these
generations have been exposed to the alternating
influence of the summer and winter temperature
a periodical dimorphism has been developed&mdash;a
regular cycle of dissimilar generations. It
has already been asserted that the consecutive
generations of a species comport themselves with
respect to heredity in a manner precisely similar
to that of the ontogenetic stages, and at the same
time such succeeding generations point out the
parallelism between metamorphosis and heterogenesis.
If influences capable of directly or indirectly
producing changes operate on any particular
stage of development, these changes are always
transmitted to the same stage. Upon this metamorphosis
depends. In a precisely similar manner
changes which operated periodically on certain
generations (1, 3, 5, for instance) are transmitted
to these generations only, and not to the intermediate
ones. Upon this depends heterogenesis.
We have just been led to the comprehension of
heterogenesis by cyclical heredity, by the fact
that a cycle is produced whenever a series of generations
exists under regularly alternating influences.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
In this cycle newly acquired changes, however
minute in character at first, are only transmitted
to a later, and not to the succeeding generation,
appearing only in the one corresponding, i.e. in
that generation which exists under similar transforming
influences. Nothing can more clearly
show the extreme importance which the conditions
of life must have upon the formation and further
development of species than this fact. At the
same time nothing shows better that the action of
these conditions is not suddenly and violently
exerted, but that it rather takes place by small and
slow operations. In these cases the long-continued
accumulation of imperceptibly small variations
proves to be the magic means by which the
forms of the organic world are so powerfully
moulded. By the application of even the greatest
warmth nobody would be able to change the winter
form of <i>A. Levana</i> into the summer form; nevertheless,
the summer warmth, acting regularly on
the second and third generations of the year, has,
in the course of a lengthened period, stamped
these two generations with a new form without the
first generation being thereby changed. In the
same region two different climatic varieties have
been produced (just as in the majority of cases
climatic varieties occur only in separate regions)
which alternate with each other, and thus give rise
to a cycle of which each generation propagates
itself sexually.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
But even if seasonal dimorphism is to be ascribed
to heterogenesis, it must by no means be asserted
that those cases of cyclical propagation hitherto
designated as heterogenesis are completely identical
with seasonal dimorphism. Their identity
extends only to their origin and manner of development,
but not to the mode of operation of
the causes which bring about their transformation.
Both phenomena have a common mode of origination,
arising from similar (monomorphic) sexual
generations and course of development, a cycle of
generations with gradually diverging characters
coming into existence by the action of alternating
influences. On the other hand, the nature of the
changes by which the secondary differs from the
primary generation may be referred to another
mode of action of the exciting causes. In seasonal
dimorphism the differences between the two generations
are much less than in other cases of heterogenesis.
These differences are both quantitatively
less, and are likewise qualitative, affecting only
characters of biological <span class="locked">insignificance.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></span> The variations
in question are mostly restricted to the
marking and colouring of the wings and body,
occasionally affecting also the form of the wing,
and in a few cases the size of the body (<i>Plebeius
Amyntas</i>), whilst the bodily structure&mdash;so far at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
least as my investigations extend&mdash;appears to be
the same in both <span class="locked">generations.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></span></p>

<p>The state of affairs is quite different in the remaining
cases of heterogenesis; here the entire
structure of the body appears to be more or less
changed, and its size is often very different,
nearly all the internal organs differing in the two
generations. According to <span class="locked">Claus,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></span> “we can
scarcely find any other explanation of the mode
of origination of heterogenesis than the gradual
and slow advantageous adaptation of the organization
to important varying conditions of life”&mdash;a
judgment in which this author is certainly correct.
In all such cases the change does not affect unimportant
characters, as it does in butterflies, but
parts of biological or physiological value; and we
cannot, therefore, consider such changes to have
originated through the <i>direct</i> action of altered
conditions of life, but <i>indirectly</i> through natural
selection or adaptation.</p>

<p>Thus, the difference between seasonal dimorphism
and the other known cases of heterogenesis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
consists in the secondary form in which the
species appears in the former originating through
the direct action of external conditions, whilst in
the latter this form most probably originates
through the indirect action of such influences.
The first half of the foregoing proposition is alone
capable of provisional proof, but it is in the
highest degree probable that the latter half is also
correct. Naturally we cannot say to what extent
the direct action of external conditions plays also
a part in true heterogenesis, as there have been
as yet no experiments made on its origin. That
direct action, working to a certain extent co-operatively,
plays only a secondary part, while the
chief cause of the change is to be found in adaptation,
no one can doubt who keeps in view, for
instance, the mode of propagation discovered by
Leuckart in <i>Ascaris nigrovenosa</i>. In this worm,
the one generation lives free in the water, and
the other generation inhabits the lungs of frogs,
the two generations differing from one another
in size of body and structure of internal organs
to an extent only possible with the true Nematoda.</p>

<p>To prevent possible misunderstanding, let it
be finally noted&mdash;even if superfluous&mdash;that the
changes causing the diversity of the two generations
in seasonal dimorphism and heterogenesis
are not of such a nature that the value of different
“specific characters” can be attached to them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
Distinctly defined specific characters are well
known not to occur generally, and it would
therefore be erroneous to attach but little value
to the differences in seasonal dimorphism because
these chiefly consist in the colouring and marking
of the wings. The question here under consideration
is not whether two animal forms have the
value of species or of mere varieties&mdash;a question
which can never be decided, since the reply always
depends upon individual opinion of the value of
the distinctions in question, and the idea of both
species and varieties is moreover purely conventional.
The question is, rather, whether the distinguishing
characters possess an equal constancy&mdash;that
is, whether they are transmitted with the same
force and accuracy to all individuals; and whether
they occur, therefore, in such a manner that they
can be practically employed as specific characters.
With respect to this, it cannot be doubtful for a
moment that the colouring and marking of a butterfly
possess exactly the same value as the constant
characters in any other group of animals, such as
the palate-folds in mice, the structure of the
teeth in mammals, the number and form of the
wing and tail feathers in birds, &amp;c. We have but
to remember with what wonderful constancy often
the most minute details of marking are transmitted
in butterflies. The systematist frequently
distinguishes between two nearly allied species, as
for instance in the <i>Lycænidæ</i>, chiefly by the position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
of certain insignificant black spots on the
under side of the wing (<i>P. Alexis</i> female, and <i>P.
Agestis</i>); and this diagnosis proves sufficient, since
<i>P. Alexis</i>, which has the spots in a straight row,
has a different caterpillar to <i>P. Agestis</i>, in which
the central spot is nearer the base of the hind
wing!</p>

<p>For the reasons just given, I maintain that it
is neither justifiable nor useful to designate the
di- and polymorphism of butterflies as di- and
polychroism, and thereby to attribute but little importance
to these <span class="locked">phenomena.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></span> This designation
would be only justifiable if the differences of colour
were due to other causes than the differences of
form, using this last word in a narrow sense. But
it has been shown that the same direct action of
climate which originates new colours, produces
also in some species differences of form (contour of
wing, size, &amp;c.); whilst, on the other hand, it has
long been known that many protective colours can
only be explained by the indirect action of external
conditions.</p>

<p>When I raise a distinction in the nature of the
changes between seasonal dimorphism and the remaining
known cases of heterogenesis, this must be
taken as referring only to the biological or physiological
result of the change in the transformed
organism itself. In seasonal dimorphism only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
insignificant characters become prominently
changed, characters which are without importance
for the welfare of the species; while in true heterogenesis
we are compelled to admit that useful
changes, or adaptations, have occurred.</p>

<p>Heterogenesis may thus be defined either in
accordance with my proposal or in the manner
hitherto adopted, since it may be regarded as more
morphological than the cyclical succession of differently
formed sexual generations; or, with Claus,
as the succession of different sexual generations,
“living under different conditions of existence”&mdash;a
definition which applies in all cases to seasonal
dimorphism. Varying conditions of existence, in
their widest sense, are the result of the action of
different climates; and a case has been made
known recently in which it is extremely probable
that the climatic differences of the seasons have
produced a cycle of generations by influencing the
processes of nutrition. This case is quite analogous
to that which we have observed in the
seasonal dimorphism of butterflies, but with the
distinction that the difference between the winter
and summer generations does not, at least entirely,
consist in the form of the reproductive adult, but
almost entirely in its ontogeny&mdash;in the mode of
its development. A comparison of this case with
the analogous phenomenon in butterflies, may
be of interest. In the remarkable fresh-water
Daphnid, <i>Leptodora hyalina</i> Lillejeborg, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
proved some years ago by P. E. Müller,<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> who
studied the ontogeny, that this last was direct, since
the embryo, before leaving the egg, already possesses
the form, members, and internal organs of
the adult. This was, at least, the case with the
summer eggs. It was subsequently shown by
<span class="locked">Sars<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></span> that this mode of development only holds
good for the summer brood, the winter eggs producing
an embryo in the spring which possesses
only the three first pairs of limbs, and, instead of
compound eyes, only a single frontal eye, thus
exhibiting briefly, at first, the structure of a <i>Nauplius</i>,
and gradually acquiring that of <i>Leptodora</i>.
The mature form derived from the winter eggs is
not distinguishable from the later generations, except
by the presence of the simple larval eye, which
appears as a small black spot. The generations
when fully developed are thus distinguished only
by this minute marking, but the summer generation
undergoes direct development, whilst the winter
generation, on the contrary, is only developed by
metamorphosis, beginning with the simplest Crustacean
type, and thus fairly representing the phyletic
development of the species. We therefore
see, in this case, the combination of a metamorphic
and a direct development taking place to a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
extent under our eyes. It cannot be proved with
certainty what the cause of this phenomenon may
be, but the conjecture is almost unavoidable that
it is closely related to the origin of the seasonal
dimorphism of butterflies, since both depend on
the alternating climatic influences of summer and
winter: it is most probable that these influences
have <span class="locked">directly<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></span> brought about a shortening of the
period of development in summer. Thus we
have here a case of heterogenesis nearly related
to the seasonal dimorphism of butterflies in a
twofold manner&mdash;first, because the cycle of generations
is also in this case brought about by the
direct action of the external conditions of life;
and secondly, the winter form is here also the
primary, and the summer form the secondary
one.</p>

<p>In accordance with the idea first introduced into
science by Rudolph Leuckart, we have hitherto
understood heterogenesis to be only the alternation
of dissimilar sexual generations. From this
point of view the reproduction of <i>Leptodora</i> can
be as little ascribed to heterogenesis as can that
of <i>Aphis</i> or <i>Daphnia</i>, although the apparent agamic
reproduction of the winter and a portion of the
summer generation is undoubtedly parthenogenesis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
and not propagation by <span class="locked">nursing.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></span> As has
already been said, however, I would attribute no
fundamental importance to the criterion of agamic
reproduction&mdash;the more especially because we are
ignorant of the physiological significance of the
two modes of propagation; and further, because this
principle of classification is entirely external, and
only valuable in so far as no better one can be
substituted for it. A separation of the modes of
cyclical propagation according to their genesis appears
to me&mdash;especially if practicable&mdash;not alone
to be of greater value, but the only correct one,
and for this the knowledge of the origin of seasonal
dimorphism seems to me to furnish a possible
method.</p>

<p>If, as was indicated above, we designate as
metagenesis (in the narrow sense) all those cases in
which it must be admitted that a series of differently
aged phyletic stages have furnished the
points of departure, and as heterogenesis those
cases in which similar phyletic stages have been
compelled to produce a cycle of generations by the
periodic action of external influences, it is clear
that the scope of heterogenesis is by this means
considerably extended, and at the same time
sharply and precisely defined.</p>

<p>Under heterogenesis then is comprised, not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
as heretofore the reproduction of <i>Ascaris nigrovenosa</i>,
of <i>Leptodora appendiculata</i>, and of the cattle-lice,
but also that of the <i>Aphides</i>, <i>Coccidæ</i>, <i>Daphniidæ</i>,
<i>Rotatoria</i>, and <i>Phyllopoda</i>, and, in short, all
those cases in which we can determine the former
identity of the two kinds of generations from their
form, anatomical structure, and mode of reproduction.
This conclusion is essentially supported by
a comparison of the most closely allied species.
Thus, for instance, when we see the genus <i>Aphis</i>
and its allies related on all sides to insects which
propagate sexually in all generations, and when
we further observe the great similarity of the
whole external and internal structure in the two
kinds of generations of <i>Aphis</i>, we are forced to
the conjecture that the apparent asexual reproduction
of the <i>Aphidæ</i> is in reality parthenogenesis,
i.e., that it has been developed from
sexual reproduction. Neither can it be any
longer disputed that in this case, as well as in that
of <i>Leptodora</i> and other <i>Daphniidæ</i>, the same
female alternately propagates parthenogenetically,
and produces eggs requiring fertilization. This
was established by Von <span class="locked">Heyden<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></span> some years
ago, in the case of <i>Lachnus Querci</i>, and has been
since confirmed by <span class="locked">Balbiani.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></span></p>

<p>There can be no doubt that in all these cases
the cycle of generations has been developed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
phyletically similar generations. But instances
are certainly conceivable which present themselves
with less clearness and simplicity. In the first
place, we do not know whether parthenogenesis
may not finally settle down into complete asexual
reproduction. Should this be the case, it might
be possible that from heterogenesis a mode of
propagation would ultimately arise, which was
apparently indistinguishable from pure metagenesis.
Such a state of affairs might result, if
the generations settling into asexual reproduction
(as, for instance, the plant-lice), at the same time
by adaptation to varying conditions of life, underwent
considerable change of structure, and
entered upon a metamorphosis to some extent
retrogressive. We should then be inclined to
regard these generations as an earlier phyletic
stage, whilst, in fact, they would be a later one,
and the idea of metagenesis would thus have been
formed after the manner of heterogenesis.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is equally conceivable
that heterogenesis may have been developed from
true metagenesis in the case of larvæ which,
having acquired the faculty of asexual propagation,
are similar in function to sexually mature
insects. This possibility is not at first sight apparent.
If the nursing-larvæ of the <i>Cecidomyiæ</i>
were as much like the sexual insects as are the
young Orthoptera to the sexually mature forms,
we should not know whether to regard them as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
degraded sexual insects, or as true larvæ which
had attained the power of asexual propagation.
Their propagation would be considered to be parthenogenesis;
and as it could not be denied that
heterogenesis was here manifest, the mode of development
of their particular kind of propagation
might be proved, i.e., it might be demonstrated,
that the generations now parthenogenetic were
formerly mere reproductive larval stages.</p>

<p>I have only offered these last observations in
order to show on what uncertain ground we are
still standing with regard to this subject whenever
we deal with the meaning of any particular
case, and how much still remains to be done. It
appears certain that the two forms of cyclical propagation,
heterogenesis and metagenesis, originate
in entirely distinct ways, so that it must be
admitted that, under these circumstances, the
idea of the existing conditions respecting the
true genesis may possibly be erroneous. To indicate
the manner in which the cyclical mode of
propagation has arisen in any single case, would
only be possible by a searching proof and complete
knowledge of existing facts in addition to
experiments.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">General Conclusions.</span></span></h4>

<p>I shall not here give a repetition and summary
of the results arrived at with respect to seasonal
dimorphism, but rather the general conclusions
derived from these results; and, at the same time,
I may take the opportunity of raising certain
questions which have not hitherto found expression,
or have been but briefly and casually stated.</p>

<p>It must, in the first place, be admitted that
differences of specific value can originate through
the direct action of external conditions of life only.
Of the truth of this proposition there can be no
doubt, after what has been above stated concerning
the difference between the two forms of any
seasonally dimorphic species. The best proof is
furnished by the older systematists, to whom the
genetic relationship of the two forms was unknown,
and who, with unprejudiced taxonomy, in
many cases indicated their distinctness by separate
specific names. This was the case with <i>Araschnia
Levana</i> and <i>Prorsa</i>, <i>Euchloe Belia</i> and <i>Ausonia</i>,
<i>E. Belemia</i> and <i>Glauce</i>, <i>Plebeius Polysperchon</i>
and <i>Amyntas</i>. In the presence of these facts it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
can scarcely be doubted that new species can be
formed in the manner indicated; and I believe
that this was and is still the case, with butterflies
at least, to a considerable extent; the more so
with these insects, because the striking colours and
markings of the wings and body, being in most
cases without biological significance, are useless for
the preservation of the individual or the species,
and cannot, therefore, be objects of natural selection.</p>

<p>Darwin must have obtained a clear insight into
this, when he attempted to attribute the markings
of butterflies to sexual and not to natural selection.
According to this view, every new colour
or marking first appears in one sex <span class="locked">accidentally,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></span>
and is there fixed by being preferred by the other
sex to the older coloration. When the new ornamentation
becomes constant (in the male for
example), Darwin supposes that it becomes transferred
to the female by inheritance, either partially
or completely, or not at all; so that the species,
therefore, remains more or less sexually dimorphic,
or (by complete transference) becomes again
sexually monomorphic.</p>

<p>The admissibility of such different, and, to a
certain extent, arbitrarily limited inheritance, has
already been acknowledged. The question here
concerned is, whether Darwin is correct when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
in this manner attributes the entire coloration of
butterflies to sexual selection. The origin of
seasonal dimorphism appears to me to be against
this view, howsoever seductive and grand the
latter may seem. If differences as important as
those which exist between the summer and winter
forms of many butterflies can be called forth by
the direct action of a changed climate, it would be
extremely hazardous to attribute great importance
to sexual selection in this particular case.</p>

<p>The principle of sexual selection appears to me
to be incontestible, and I will not deny that it is
also effective in the case of butterflies; but I believe
that as a final explanation of colour this agency
can be dispensed with, inasmuch as we see that
considerable changes of colour can occur without
the influence of sexual <span class="locked">selection.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
The question now arises, how far does the
transforming influence of climate extend? When
a species has become transformed by climatic
change to such an extent that its new form possesses
the systematic value of a new species, does
it return to its older form by removal to the old
climatic conditions? or would it under these circumstances
become again transformed in a new
manner? This question is not without importance,
inasmuch as in the first case climatic
influences would be of little value in the formation
of species, and there would result at most
only a fluctuation between two extremes. In the
same manner as in seasonally dimorphic species
the summer and winter forms now alternate with
each other every year, so would the forms produced
by warmth and cold then alternate in the
greater periods of the earth’s history. Other
groups of animals are certainly changed by the
action of different climatic influences; but in butterflies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
as I believe I have proved, temperature
plays the chief part, and as this only oscillates between
rather narrow limits, it admits of no great
differences of coloration.</p>

<p>The question thus suggests itself, whether
species of butterflies only oscillate between two
forms, or whether climatic change, when sufficiently
great to produce variation, does not again originate
a new form. Inasmuch as the reversion
experiments with seasonally dimorphic butterflies
appear to correspond with the latter view, I
believe that this must be admitted. I am of
opinion that an old form never again arises
through change of climate, but always a new
one; so that a periodically recurring change of
climate is alone sufficient, in the course of a long
period of time, to admit of new species arising
from one another. This, at least, may be the case
with butterflies.</p>

<p>My views rest essentially upon theoretical considerations.
It has already been insisted upon,
as results immediately from the experiments, that
temperature does not act on the physical constitution
of the individual in the same manner as acid
or alkali upon litmus paper, i.e., that one and the
same individual does not produce this or that
coloration and marking according as it is exposed
to warmth or cold; but rather that climate, when
it influences in a similar manner many succeeding
generations, gradually produces such a change in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
the physical constitution of the species that this
manifests itself by other colours and markings.
Now when this newly acquired physical constitution,
established, as we may admit, throughout
a long series of generations, is again submitted
to a constant change of climate, this influence,
even if precisely similar to that which obtained
during the period of the first form of the species,
cannot possibly reproduce this first form. The
nature of the external conditions may be the
same, but not so the physical constitution of the
species. Just in the same manner as a <i>Pieris</i> (as
has been already shown), a <i>Lycæna</i>, or a <i>Satyrus</i>,
produces quite different varieties under the transforming
influence of the same climate, so must the
variation originating from the transformed species of
our present case after the beginning of the primary
climate be different from that primary form of the
species, although perhaps in a less degree. In
other words, if only two different climates alternated
with each other during the earth’s geological
periods, every species of butterfly submitted to
these changes of climate would give rise to an
endless series of different specific forms. The
difference of climate would in reality be greater
than supposed, and for any given species the
climatic variation would not only occur through
the periodic shifting of the ecliptic, but also through
geological changes and the migrations of the
species itself, so that a continuous change of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
species must have gone on from this sole cause
of alternation of climate. When we consider
that many species elsewhere extinct have become
locally preserved, and when, further, to these we
add those local forms which have arisen by the
prevention of crossing (amixia), and finally take
into consideration the important effects of sexual
selection, we can no longer be astonished at the
vast numbers of species of butterflies which we
now meet with on the earth.</p>

<p>Should any one be inclined to conclude, from my
reversion experiments with seasonally dimorphic
butterflies, that the secondary species when exposed
to the same climate as that which produced
it must revert to the primary, he forgets that this
reversion to the winter form is nothing but a
reversion&mdash;i.e., a sudden return to a primary form
through peculiar laws of inheritance&mdash;and by no
means a gradual re-acquisition of this primary
form under the gradual influence of the primary
climate. Reversion to the winter form occurs also
through other influences, as, for instance, by high
temperature. Reversions of this kind, depending
on laws of heredity, certainly happen with those
cases of transmutation which do not alternate with
the primary form, as in seasonal dimorphism, but
which occur continuously. They would, however
probably be more quickly suppressed in such
cases than in seasonal dimorphism, where the
constant alternation of the primary and secondary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
forms must always maintain the tendency of the
latter to produce the former.</p>

<p>That the above conclusion is correct&mdash;that a
secondary species, when exposed to the external
conditions under the influence of which the
primary form originated, does not again revert to
the latter&mdash;is proved by experience with plants.
<span class="locked">Botanists<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></span> assure us “that cultivated races which
become wild, and are thus brought back to their
former conditions of life, do not become changed
into the original wild form, but into some new
one.”</p>

<p>A second point which appears to me to be
elucidated by seasonal dimorphism, is the origin
of variability. It has already been prominently
shown that secondary forms are for the most part
considerably more variable than primary forms.
From this it follows that similar external influences
either induce different changes in the
different individuals of a species, or else change all
individuals in the same manner, variability arising
only from the unequal time in which the individuals
are exposed to the external influence.
The latter is undoubtedly the case, as appears
from the differences which are shown by the
various individuals of a secondary form. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
are always only differences of degree and not of
kind, as is perhaps most distinctly shown by the
very variable <i>A. Prorsa</i> (summer form), in which
all the occurring variations differ only by the
<i>Levana</i> marking being more or less absent, and,
at the same time, by approximating more or less
to the pure <i>Prorsa</i> marking; but changes in a
totally different direction never occur. It is likewise
further evident, as has been mentioned above,
that allied species and genera, and even entire
families (<i>Pieridæ</i>), are changed by similar external
inducing causes in the same manner&mdash;or, better, in
the same direction.</p>

<p>In accordance with these facts the law may be
stated, that, in butterflies at least, all the individuals
of a species respond to the same external
influences by similar changes, and that, consequently,
the changes brought about by climatic
influences take a fixed direction, determined by
the physical constitution of the species. When,
however, new climatic forms of butterflies, in which
natural selection is completely excluded, and the
nature of the species itself definitely determines
the direction of the changes, nevertheless show
variability from the very beginning, we may
venture to conclude that every transformation of a
species generally begins with a fluctuation of its
characters. But when we find the primary forms
of butterflies always far more constant, this shows
that the continued crossing of the individuals of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
species to a certain extent balances the fluctuations
of form. Both facts taken together confirm the
law formerly enunciated by <span class="locked">me,<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></span> that in every
species a period of variability alternates with one
of (relative) constancy&mdash;the latter indicating the
culmination, and the former the beginning or end,
of its development. I here call to mind this law,
because the facts which I advanced at that time,
viz., Hilgendorf’s history of the phyletic development
of the Steinheim fossil shells, having since
become somewhat doubtful, one might easily be
inclined to go too far in mistrusting them and refuse
to give them any weight at <span class="locked">all.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></span></p>

<p>In the essay just indicated I traced the origin
of a certain class of local forms to local isolation.
I attempted to show that when a species finds
itself in an isolated district in a condition (period)
of variability, it must there necessarily acquire
somewhat deviating characters by being prevented
from crossing with the individuals of other regions,
or, what comes to the same thing, a local form
must originate. This production of local forms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
results because the different variations which, for
the time being, constitute the variability of the
species, would always be in a different numerical
proportion in the isolated district as compared with
other regions; and further, because constancy is
produced by the crossing of these (isolated)
varieties among themselves; so that the resultant
of the various components is (local) variation. If
the components are dissimilar the resultant would
also be different, and thus, from a theoretical
point of view, there seems to me no obstacle in
the way of the production of such local forms by
the process of ‘amixia.’ I believe that I have
further shown that numerous local forms can
be conceived to have arisen through this process
of preventive crossing, whilst they cannot be explained
by the action of climatic influences.</p>

<p>That I do not deny the existence of true climatic
forms in admitting this principle of ‘amixia,’ as
has been frequently imagined, appears sufficiently
from the treatise in question. The question
arises, however, whether climatic influences
may not also originate forms by ‘amixia’ by
making a species variable. It would be difficult
at present to decide finally upon this subject.
If, however, in all cases a variation in a certain
fixed direction occurred through climatic influences,
a form could not arise by ‘amixia’ from such a
variability, since the components could then produce
resultants different only in degree and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
in kind. But we are not yet able to extend our
researches to such fine distinctions.</p>

<p>As a final, and not unimportant result of these
investigations, I may once more insist that dissimilar
influences, when they alternatingly affect
a long series of originally similar generations in
regularly recurring change, only modify the generations
concerned, and not intermediate ones. Or,
more briefly, cyclically acting causes of change
produce cyclically recurring changes: under their
influence series of monomorphic generations become
formed into a cycle of di- or polymorphic
generations.</p>

<p>There is no occasion to return here to the immediate
evidence and proof of the foregoing law.
In the latter, however, is comprised the question&mdash;is
not the cycle of generations produced by cyclical
heredity ultimately equivalent to Darwin and
Haeckel’s homochronic heredity which forms the
ontogenetic stages into a cycle? It is possible
that from this point, in the future, the nature of the
processes of heredity, which are still so obscure,
may be penetrated into, and both phenomena
traced to the same cause, as can now be only surmised
but not clearly perceived.</p>

<p>Finally, the most general, and in so far chief
result of these investigations, appears to me to lie
in the conclusion, which may be thus formulated:&mdash;A
species is only caused to change through the
influence of changing external conditions of life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
this change being in a fixed direction which entirely
depends on the physical nature of the varying
organism, and is different in different species, or
even in the two sexes of the same species.</p>

<p>I am so little disposed to speak in favour of an
unknown transforming power that I may here
again insist that the transformation of a species
only partly depends upon external influences, and
partly on the specific constitution of the particular
form. I designate this constitution ‘specific,’
inasmuch as it responds to the same inciting cause
in a manner different to the constitution of another
species. We can generally form a clear conception
why this should be the case; for not only is
there in another species a different kind of latent
vital activity, but each species has also a different
developmental history. It must be admitted that,
from the earliest period of the formation of an organism,
and throughout all its intermediate stages,
properties which have become established, such as
growth, nutrition, or tendency to development,
have been transferred to the species now existing,
each of which bears these tendencies in itself to
a certain extent. It is these innate tendencies
which determine the external and internal appearance
of the species at every period of its life, and
which, by their reaction to external factors, represent
the life of the individual as well as that of the
species. Since the sum of these inherited tendencies
must vary more or less in every species,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
not only is the different external appearance of
species as well as their physiological and biological
diversity thus explained, but it necessarily follows
therefrom, that different species must respond differently
to those external causes which tend to
produce a change in their form.</p>

<p>Now, this last conclusion is equivalent to the
statement that every species, through its physical
constitution, (in the sense defined) is impressed
with certain fixed powers of variation, which are
evidently extraordinarily numerous in the case of
each species, but are not unlimited; they permit
of a wide range for the action of natural selection,
but they also limit its functions, since they certainly
restrain the course of development, however wide
the latter may be. I have elsewhere previously
<span class="locked">insisted<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></span> that too little is ascribed to the part played
by the physical constitution of species in the history
of their transformation, when the course of
this transformation is attributed entirely to external
conditions. Darwin certainly admits the importance
of this factor, but only so far as it concerns
the individual variation, the nature of which appears
to him to depend on the physical constitution
of the species. I believe, however, that in this
directive influence lies the precise reason why,
under the most favourable external circumstances,
a bird can never become transformed into a mammal&mdash;or,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
to express myself generally, why, from a
given starting-point, the development of a particular
species cannot now attain, even under the
most favourable external conditions, any desired
goal; and why, from this starting-point, given
courses of development, even when of considerable
latitude, must be restricted, just as a ball
rolling down a hill is diverted by a fixed
obstacle in a direction determined by the position
of the latter, and depending on the direction
of motion and the velocity at the moment of
being diverted.</p>

<p>In this sense I agree with Askenasy’s “fixed”
direction of variation; but not if another new
physical force directing variation itself is thereby
<span class="locked">intended.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></span> The explanation of the phenomena
does not appear to me to require such an admission,
and, if unnecessary, it is certainly not legitimate.
According to my view, transmutation by purely
internal causes is not to be entertained. If we
could absolutely suspend the changes of the external
conditions of life, existing species would
remain stationary. The action of external inciting
causes, in the widest sense of the word, is alone able
to produce modifications; and even the never-failing
“individual variations,” together with the
inherited dissimilarity of constitution, appear to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
me to depend upon unlike external influences,
the inherited constitution itself being dissimilar
because the individuals have been at all
times exposed to somewhat varying external
influences.</p>

<p>A change arising from purely internal causes
seems to me above all quite untenable, because I
cannot imagine how the same material substratum
of physical constitution of a species can be transferred
to the succeeding generation as two opposing
tendencies. Yet this must be the case if the
direction of development transferred by heredity
is to be regarded as the ultimate ground both of
the similarity and dissimilarity to the ancestors.
All changes, from the least to the greatest, appear
to me to depend ultimately only on external influences;
they are the response of the organism to
external inciting causes. It is evident that this
response must be different when a physical constitution
of a different nature is affected by the same
inciting cause, and upon this, according to my
view, depends the great importance of these constitutional
differences.</p>

<p>If, under “heredity,” we comprise the totality of
inheritance&mdash;that is to say, the physical constitution
of a species at any time, and therefore the
restricted and, in the foregoing sense, pre-determined
power of variation, whilst under “adaptation”
we comprehend the direct and indirect
response of this physical constitution to the changes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
in the conditions of life, I can agree with Haeckel’s
mode of expression, and with him trace the transformation
of species to the two factors of heredity
and adaptation.</p>

<p>All these butterflies were of the <i>Prorsa</i> type, 3 females
having a considerable amount of yellow, but none with
so much as figs. 3, 4, 7, 8, or 9. <a href="#Plate_I">Pl. I</a>.</p>

<p>2. August 12th, 1868, found larvæ of the third generation,
which pupated at the beginning of September,
and were kept in a room not warmed. In September
three butterflies emerged in the <i>Prorsa</i> form, the remainder
hibernating and producing, after being placed
in a heated room at the end of February, from the 1st to
the 17th of March, 1869, more butterflies, all of the
<i>Levana</i> form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
3. Larvæ found on the 17th June, 1869, were sorted
according to colour; the yellow ones, with light brown
spines, produced, at the ordinary temperature, on 8th-12th
July, 13 butterflies, 12 of which showed the ordinary
<i>Prorsa</i> type, and one, a male, possessing more yellow
than fig. 3, <a href="#Plate_I">Pl. I</a>., must be considered as a <i>Porima</i>
type.</p>

<p>4. From caterpillars of the second generation, found
at the same time as those of Exp. <a href="#P1-A1">3</a>, 30 pupæ were
placed in the refrigerator (temperature 8°-10° R.) on
June 25th. When the box was opened on August 3rd,
almost all had emerged, many being dead, and all,
without exception, were of the intermediate form
(<i>Porima</i>), although nearer the <i>Prorsa</i> than the <i>Levana</i>
type.</p>

<p>5. A large number of caterpillars of the second generation,
found at the same time, pupated, and were kept at
a high summer temperature. After a pupal period of
about 19 days, some 70 butterflies emerged from 28th
June to 5th July, all of the <i>Prorsa</i> form, with the exception
of 5, which were strongly marked with yellow
(<i>Porima</i>).</p>

<p>6. The 70 butterflies of the foregoing experiment were
placed in an enclosure 6 feet high, and 8 feet long, in
which, during warm weather, they freely swarmed on
flowers. Copulation was only once observed, and but
one female laid eggs on nettle on July 4th. At the
high summer temperature prevailing at the time, these
eggs produced butterflies after 30&ndash;31 days (third
generation). All were <i>Prorsa</i>, with more or less yellow;
among 18 none were completely <i>Porima</i>.</p>

<p>7. Young larvæ of the fourth generation, found on the
8th of August, were reared in a hothouse (17°-20° R.).
They pupated on 21st-23rd August. Of <span class="locked">these:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>A. 56 pupæ were placed on ice (0°-1° R.) for five
weeks, and then allowed to hibernate in a room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
not warmed. In April, 1870, they all gave the <i>Levana</i>

a temperature of 12°-24° R., not a single butterfly
emerged in the course of October and November. The

<p>The exact record of the time of emergence is interesting,
because it is thereby rendered apparent that different
individuals respond more in different degrees to a higher
than to the ordinary temperature. Whilst with many
an acceleration of development of 1&ndash;2 months occurred,
others emerged in April and May, i.e. at the time of
their appearance in the natural state.</p>

<p>It must be pointed out, however, that among those
specimens marked as “<i>Levana</i>” there were none which
entirely corresponded with the natural <i>Levana</i>, or which
indeed approximated so nearly to this form as did
some of the specimens in Exp. <a href="#P1-A1">9</a>. All were larger
than the natural <i>Levana</i>, and possessed, notwithstanding
the large amount of yellow, more black than any true
<i>Levana</i>. In all artificially bred <i>Levana</i> the black band
of the basal half of the hind wings is always interrupted
with yellow, which is seldom the case with true <i>Levana</i>.
The whole appearance of the artificial <i>Levana</i> is also
coarser, and the contour of the wings somewhat different,
the fore-wings being broader and less pointed. (See figs.
7 to 9, <a href="#Plate_I">Pl. I</a>.).</p>

<p>15. Several butterflies from Exp. <a href="#P1-A1">14</a>, which emerged
in May, 1873, were placed in a capacious breeding-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>house,
where they copulated and laid eggs on rape.
The caterpillars fed on the living plants in the breeding-house,
and after pupation were divided into two <span class="locked">portions:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>A. Several pupæ, kept at the ordinary summer temperature,
gave butterflies on July 2nd, having the characters
of the summer form.</p>

<p>B. The remainder of the pupæ were placed on ice immediately
after transformation, and remained over three
months in the refrigerator (from July 1st till October
10th). Unfortunately most of them perished through
the penetration of moisture into the box. Only 8 survived,
3 of which emerged on the 20th of October as the
winter form; the others hibernated in an unheated
room, and emerged at the beginning of June, 1874. All
5 were females, and all exhibited the characters of the
winter form. Notwithstanding a pupal period of eleven
months, they did not possess these characters to a greater
extent than usual, and did not, therefore, approximate
to the parent-form <i>Bryoniæ</i>.</p>

<p>16. On June 12th, 1871, specimens of <i>Pieris Napi</i>, var.
<i>Bryoniæ</i>, were captured on a mountain in the neighbourhood
of Oberstorf (Allgäuer Alpen), and placed in a
breeding-house, where they flew freely about the flowers;
but although copulation did not take place, several
females laid eggs on the ordinary garden cabbage.
From these caterpillars were hatched, which at all stages
of growth were exactly like those of the ordinary form
of <i>Napi</i>. They throve well until shortly before pupation,
when a fungoid epidemic decimated them, so that from
300 caterpillars only about 40 living pupæ were obtained.
These also completely resembled the ordinary
form of <i>Napi</i>, and showed the same polymorphism, some
being beautifully green, others (the majority) straw
yellow, and others yellowish grey. Only one butterfly
emerged the same summer, a male, which, by the black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
dusting of the veins on the margin of the wings (upper
side), could be with certainty recognized as var. <i>Bryoniæ</i>.
The remaining pupæ hibernated in a heated room, and
gave, from the end of January to the beginning of June,
10 males and 5 females, all with the characters of the
var. <i>Bryoniæ</i>. They <span class="locked">emerged:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>We here perceive that the tendency to accelerate
development through the action of warmth is, in this
case, also very different in different individuals. Of the
16 butterflies only 1 kept to the normal period of development
from July 27th to June 3rd, fully ten months;
all the others had this period abbreviated, 1 male to
eleven days, 8 specimens to six months, 4 to seven
months, 2 to eight months, and 1 to nine months.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Experiments with Papilio Ajax.</span><a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor smaller">58</a></h5>

<p>From eggs of var. <i>Telamonides</i> laid on the last of May
larvæ were obtained, which gave on June 22nd-26th,
122 pupæ. These, as fast as formed, were placed on ice
in the refrigerator in small tin boxes, and when all the
larvæ had become transformed the pupæ were transferred
to a cylindrical tin box (4 in. diam. and 6 in.
high), and packed in layers between fine shavings. The
tin box was set in a small wooden one, which was put
directly on the ice and kept there till July 20th. From
that date, by an unfortunate accident, the box, instead
of being kept on the surface of the ice in an ice-house,
as was intended, was placed on straw near the ice, so
that the action of the cold was modified, the outside
pupæ certainly experiencing its full effects, but the inside
ones were probably at a somewhat higher temperature.
The ice failed on August 20th, so that the pupæ
had been subjected to an equable low temperature in
the refrigerator for three to four weeks, and to a lesser
degree of cold in the ice-house for five weeks, the temperature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
of the last place rising daily, as the ice had all
thawed by August 20th. On opening the box it was
found (probably owing to the cold not having been
sufficiently severe) that the butterflies had commenced
to emerge. Twenty-seven dead and crippled specimens
were removed, together with several dead pupæ. One
butterfly that had just emerged was taken out and
placed in a box, and when its wings had fully expanded
it was found to be a “<i>Telamonides</i> of the most pronounced
type.” The experimenter then states:&mdash;“Early
in the morning I made search for the dead and
rejected butterflies, and recovered a few. It was not
possible to examine them very closely from the wet and
decayed condition they were in, but I was able to discover
the broad crimson band which lies above the
inner angle of the hind wings, and which is usually lined
on its anterior side with white, and is characteristic of
either <i>Walshii</i> or <i>Telamonides</i>, but is not found in
<i>Marcellus</i>. And the tip only of the tail being white in
<i>Walshii</i>, while both tip and sides are white in <i>Telamonides</i>,
enabled me to identify the form as between these
two. There certainly were no <i>Walshii</i>, but there seemed
to be a single <i>Marcellus</i>, and excepting that all were
<i>Telamonides</i>.”</p>

<p>The remaining pupæ were kept in a light room where
3 <i>Telamonides</i> emerged the following day, and by September
4th 14 specimens of the same variety had
emerged, but no <i>Marcellus</i> or intermediate forms. From
the 4th to the 20th of September a few more <i>Telamonides</i>
appeared, but between the 4th and 15th of the
month 12 out of 26 butterflies that had emerged were
intermediate between <i>Telamonides</i> and <i>Marcellus</i>, some
approximating to one form and some to the other form.
The first pure <i>Marcellus</i> appeared on September 4th,
and was followed by one specimen on the 6th, 8th,
13th and 15th respectively. From this last date to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
October 3rd, 6 out of 10 were <i>Marcellus</i> and 3 intermediate.
On September 3rd, a specimen intermediate
between <i>Telamonides</i> and <i>Walshii</i> emerged, “in which
the tails were white tipped as in <i>Walshii</i>, but in size
and other characters it was <i>Telamonides</i>, though the
crimson band might have belonged to either form.”
Butterflies continued to emerge daily up to September
20th, after which date single specimens appeared at intervals
of from four to six days, the last emergence
being on October 16th. Thus, from the time the box was
removed from the ice-house, the total period of emerging
was fifty-seven days, some specimens having emerged
before the removal of the box. With specimens of <i>P.
Ajax</i> which appear on the wing the first season the
natural pupal period is about fourteen days, individuals
rarely emerging after a period of four to six weeks.</p>

<p>All these butterflies were very uniform in size, being
about that of the ordinary <i>Telamonides</i>. The specimens
of <i>Telamonides</i> especially were “strongly marked, the
crimson band in a large proportion of them being as
conspicuous as is usual in <i>Walshii</i>, and the blue lunules
near the tail were remarkably large and bright coloured.
Of the <i>Marcellus</i>, in addition to the somewhat reduced size,
the tails were almost invariably shorter than usual and
narrower, and instead of the characteristic single crimson
spot, nearly all had two spots, often large. In all these
particulars they approach <i>Telamonides</i>.”</p>

<p>Adding to the <i>Telamonides</i> which emerged after
August 20th most of those specimens which were found
dead in the box at that date, the total number of this
form is thus brought up to nearly 50. Of the 122 pupæ
with which Mr. Edwards started, 28 remained in a state
fit for hibernation, several having died without emerging.
Previous experiments had shown that 28 out of 122
pupæ is not an unreasonable number to hibernate, so that
the author concludes that the butterflies which emerged
the same season would have done so naturally, and
the effect of the artificial cold was not “to precipitate
the emerging of any which would have slept” till the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
following spring. Now under ordinary circumstances
all the butterflies which emerged the same season would
have been of the <i>Marcellus</i> form, so that the cold changed
a large part of these into the form <i>Telamonides</i>, some
(probably from those pupæ which experienced the lowest
temperature) being completely changed, and others
(from those pupæ which were only imperfectly subjected
to the cold) being intermediate, <i>i.e.</i>, only partly changed.
It appears also that several pupæ experienced sufficient
cold to retard their emergence and stunt their growth,
but not enough to change their form, these being the 13
recorded specimens of <i>Marcellus</i>. Had the degree of
cold been equal and constant, the reversion would probably
have been more complete. The application of
cold produced great confusion in the duration of the
pupal period, the emergence, instead of taking place
fourteen days after the withdrawal of the cold, as might
have been expected from Dr. Weismann’s corresponding
experiment with <i>Pieris Napi</i> (<a href="#P1-A1">Appendix I</a>. Exps. <a href="#P1-A1">13</a> and
14), having been extended over more than two months.</p>

<p>From the results of this experiment it must be concluded
that <i>Telamonides</i> is the primary form of the
species.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Additional Experiments with Papilio Ajax.</span></h5>

<p class="center">[<i>Communicated by</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">W. H. Edwards</span>, <i>November 18th, 1879</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Exp.</span> 1.&mdash;In 1877 chrysalides of <i>P. Ajax</i> and <i>Grapta
Interrogationis</i> (the eggs laid by females of the form
<i>Fabricii</i>) were experimented upon; but the results were not
satisfactory, for the reason that the author having been
absent from home most of the time while the pupæ were
in the ice-box, on his return found the temperature above
5°-6° R. And so far as could be told, the ice had been
put in irregularly, and there might have been intervals
during which no ice at all was in the box. Six chrysalides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
of the <i>Grapta</i> so exposed produced unchanged
<i>Umbrosa</i>, the co-form with <i>Fabricii</i>. But all chrysalides
from the same lot of eggs, and not exposed to cold, also
produced <i>Umbrosa</i>. Nothing was learnt, therefore, respecting
this species.</p>

<p>But chrysalides of <i>Ajax</i>, exposed at same time, did
give changed butterflies to some extent. From a lot of
8, placed in the box when under twelve hours from
pupation, and left for twenty-four days, there came 5
males and 3 females. Of these was 1 <i>Telamonides</i> in
markings and coloration, and all the rest were between
<i>Marcellus</i> and <i>Telamonides</i>. Two other chrysalides on
ice for twenty-three days gave <i>Telamonides</i>, but 3 more
exposed twenty-six days, and all one hour old when put
on ice, were unchanged, producing <i>Marcellus</i>.</p>

<p>During the same season 6 other <i>Ajax</i> chrysalides were
placed in the box, and kept at about 0°-1° R. One was
one hour old, and remained for five days; 1 was one
hour old, and remained for two days and three-quarters;
3 at three hours old for eight days; and 1 (age omitted),
six days. All these gave unchanged butterflies of the
form <i>Marcellus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Exp.</span> 2.&mdash;In May, 1878, many chrysalides were placed
in the ice-box, being from eggs laid by <i>Ajax</i>, var. <i>Walshii</i>.
The youngest were but ten to fifteen minutes from pupation,
and were soft; others at intervals up to twenty-four
hours (the chrysalis is hard at about twelve hours);
after that, each day up to eight days after pupation.
All were removed from the box on the same day, 28th
May. The exposure was from nineteen to five days, those
chrysalides which were put on ice latest having the shortest
exposure. The author wished to determine if possible
whether, in order to effect any change, it was necessary
that cold should be applied immediately after pupation
or if one or several days might intervene between pupation
and refrigeration. Inasmuch as no colour begins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
to show itself in the pupæ till a few hours, or at most a
day or two, before the butterfly emerges, it was thought
possible that cold applied shortly before that time would
be quite as effective as if applied earlier and especially
very soon after pupation. The result was, that more than
half of the chrysalides exposed before they had hardened
died: 1 exposed at ten minutes, 2 at one hour, 1 at two
hours, 2 at three hours after pupation. On the other hand
1 at fifteen minutes produced a butterfly, 1 at two hours,
another at twelve hours. The temperature was from
0°-1° R. most of the time, but varied somewhat each
day as the ice melted. The normal chrysalis period is
from eleven to fourteen days, in case the butterfly
emerges the same season, but very rarely an individual
will emerge several weeks after pupation.</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>On the 14th day after taking the pupæ from the ice,
1 <i>Telamonides</i> emerged from a chrysalis which
had been placed in the ice-box three days after
pupation, and was on ice sixteen days.</p>

<p>On 19th day, 1 <i>Telamonides</i> emerged from a pupa put on
the ice twelve hours after pupation, and kept
there eleven days.</p>

<p>On 19th day, 1 <i>Walshii</i> emerged from a pupa two hours
old, and on ice eleven days.</p></blockquote>

<p>All the rest emerged <i>Marcellus</i>, unchanged, but at
periods prolonged in a surprising way.</p>

Five chrysalides lived through the winter, and all gave
<i>Telamonides</i> in the spring of 1879.</p>

<p>It appeared, therefore, that the only effect produced
by cold in all chrysalides exposed more than three days
after pupation was to retard the emergence of the butterfly.
But even in some of these earliest exposed, and
kept on the ice for full nineteen days, the only effect
seemed to be to retard the butterfly.</p>

days at least past the regular period of the species.</p>

<p>Of the iced chrysalides, from lot No. 1 emerged 4
females at eight days and a half to nine days and a half
after removal from the ice, and 5 are now alive (Nov. 18)
and will go over the winter.</p>

<p>From lot No. 2 emerged 1 male and 5 females at
eight to nine days; another male came out at forty
days; and 5 will hibernate.</p>

<p>From lot No. 3 emerged 4 females at nine to twelve
days; another male came out at fifty-four days; and 6
were found to be dead.</p>

<p>In this experiment the author wished to see as exactly
as possible&mdash;First, in what points changes would occur.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
Second, if there would be any change in the shape of
the wings, as well as in markings or coloration&mdash;that is,
whether the shape might remain as that of <i>Marcellus</i>,
while the markings might be of <i>Telamonides</i> or <i>Walshii</i>;
a summer form with winter markings. Third, to ascertain
more closely than had yet been done what length of
exposure was required to bring about a decided change,
and what would be the effect of prolonging this period.
After the experiments with <i>Phyciodes Tharos</i>, which had
resulted in a suffusion of colour, the author hoped that
some similar cases might be seen in <i>Ajax</i>. The
decided changes in 1878 had been produced by eleven
and sixteen days’ cold. In 1877, an exposure of two
days and three-quarters to eight days had failed to
produce an effect.</p>

<p>From these chrysalides 11 perfect butterflies were obtained,
1 male and 10 females. Some emerged crippled,
and these were rejected, as it was not possible to make
out the markings satisfactorily.</p>

<p>From lot No. 1, fourteen days, <span class="locked">came:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="in0 in2">
1 female between <i>Marcellus</i> and <i>Telamonides</i>.<br />
2 females, <i>Marcellus</i>.
</p>

<p>These 2 <i>Marcellus</i> were pale coloured, the light parts
a dirty white; the submarginal lunules on hind wings
were only two in number and small; at the anal angle
was one large and one small red spot; the frontal hairs
were very short. The first, or intermediate female, was
also pale black, but the light parts were more green and
less sordid; there were 3 large lunules; the anal red
spot was double and connected, as in <i>Telamonides</i>; the
frontal hairs short, as in <i>Marcellus</i>. These are the
most salient points for comparing the several forms
of <i>Ajax</i>. In nature, there is much difference in shape
between <i>Marcellus</i> and <i>Telamonides</i>, still more between
<i>Marcellus</i> and <i>Walshii</i>; and the latter may be distinguished
from the other winter forms by the white tips of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
the tails. It is also smaller, and the anal spot is larger,
with a broad white edging.</p>

<p>In general shape all were <i>Marcellus</i>, the wings produced,
the tails long.</p>

<p>From this it appeared that those exposed twenty-five
days were fully changed; of those exposed twenty days,
3 were fully, 2 partly, 1 not at all; and of those exposed
fourteen days, 1 partly, 2 not at all.</p>

<p>The butterflies from this lot of 104 chrysalides, but
which had not been iced, were put in papers. Taking 6
males and 6 females from the papers just as they came
to hand, Mr. Edwards set them, and compared them
with the iced examples.</p>

<p>Of the 6 males, 4 had 1 red anal spot only, 2 had 1 large
1 small; 4 had 2 green lunules on the hind wings, 2 had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
3, and in these last there was a 4th obsolescent, at outer
angle; all had short frontal hairs.</p>

<p>Of the 6 females, 5 had but 1 red spot, 1 had 1 large 1
small spot; 5 had 2 lunules only, 1 had 3; all had short
frontal hairs.</p>

<p>Comparing 6 of the females from the iced chrysalides,
being those in which a change had more or less occurred,
with the 6 females not iced:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>1. All the former had the colours more intense, the
black deeper, the light, green.</p>

<p>2. In 5 of the former the green lunules on hind
wings were decidedly larger; 3 of the 6 had 4
distinct lunules, 1 had 3, 1 had 3, and a 4th
obsolescent. Of the 6 females not iced none
had 4, 2 had 2, and a 3rd, the lowest of the row,
obsolescent; 3 had 3, the lowest being very
small; one had 3, and a 4th, at outer angle,
obsolescent.</p>

<p>3. In all the former the subapical spot on fore wing
and the stripe on same wing which crosses the
cell inside the common black band, were distinct
and green; in all the latter these marks were
either obscure or obsolescent.</p>

<p>4. In 4 of the former there was a large double connected
red spot, and in one of the 4 it was edged with
white on its upper side; 2 had 1 large and 1 small
red spot. Of the latter 5 had 1 spot only, and
the 6th had 1 spot and a red dot.</p>

<p>5. The former had all the black portions of the wing
of deeper colour but less diffused, the bands being
narrower; on the other hand, the green bands were
wider as well as deeper coloured. Measuring the
width of the outermost common green band along
the middle of the upper medium interspace on
fore wing in tenths of a millimetre, it was found
to be as follows:</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span></p>

<table summary="The former had all the black portions">

  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">On the not iced</td>
    <td class="tdl">56, 56, 51, 51, 46, 51.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Measuring the common black discal band across the
middle of the lower medium interspace on fore wing:</p>

<table summary="Measuring the common black discal band">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">On the iced pupæ</td>
    <td class="tdl">51, 66, 51, 51, 56, 61.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">On the not iced</td>
    <td class="tdl">76, 71, 66, 63, 71, 76.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In other words the natural examples were more
melanic than the others.</p>

<p>No difference was found in the length of the tails or
in the length and breadth of wings. In other words, the
cold had not altered the shape of the wings.</p>

<p>Comparing 1 male iced with 6 males not iced:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>1. The former had a large double connected red anal
spot, edged with white scales at top. Of the 6
not iced, 3 had but 1 red spot, 2 had 1 large 1
small, 1 had 1 large and a red dot.</p>

<p>2. The former had 4 green lunules; of the latter 3
had 3, 3 had only 2.</p>

<p>3. The former had the subapical spot and stripe in
the cells clear green; of the latter 1 had the same,
5 had these obscure or obsolescent.</p>

<p>4. The colours of the iced male were bright; of the
others, 2 were the same, 4 had the black pale, the
light sordid white or greenish-white.</p></blockquote>

<p>Looking over all, male and female, of both lots, the
large size of the green submarginal lunules on the fore
wings in the iced examples was found to be conspicuous
as compared with all those not iced, though this feature
is included in the general widening of the green bands
spoken of.</p>

<p>In all the experiments with <i>Ajax</i>, if any change at all
has been produced by cold, it is seen in the enlarging
or doubling of the red anal spot, and in the increased
number of clear green lunules on the hind wings. Almost
always the frontal hairs are lengthened and the colour of
the wings deepened, and the extent of the black area is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
also diminished. All these changes are in the direction
of <i>Telamonides</i>, or the winter form.</p>

<p>That the effect of cold is not simply to precipitate the
appearance of the winter form, causing the butterfly to
emerge from the chrysalis in the summer in which it began
its larval existence instead of the succeeding year, is
evident from the fact that the butterflies come forth with
the shape of <i>Marcellus</i>, although the markings may be of
<i>Telamonides</i> or <i>Walshii</i>. And almost always some of
the chrysalides, after having been iced, go over the
winter, and then produce <i>Telamonides</i>, as do the hibernating
pupæ in their natural state. The cold appears to
have no effect on these individual <span class="locked">chrysalides.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></span></p>

<p>With every experiment, however similar the conditions
seem to be, and are intended to be, there is a
difference in results; and further experiments&mdash;perhaps
many&mdash;will be required before the cause of this is understood.
For example, in 1878, the first butterfly emerged
on the fourteenth day after removal from ice, the period
being exactly what it is (at its longest) in the species in
nature. Others emerged at 19&ndash;96 days. In 1879, the
emergence began on the ninth day, and by the twelfth day
all had come out, except three belated individuals, which
came out at twenty, forty, and fifty-four days. In the
last experiment, either the cold had not fully suspended
the changes which the insect undergoes in the chrysalis,
or its action was to hasten them after the chrysalides were
taken from the ice. In the first experiment, apparently
the changes were absolutely suspended as long as the
cold remained.</p>

<p>It might be expected that the application of heat
to the hibernating chrysalides would precipitate the
appearance of the summer form, or change the markings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
of the butterfly into the summer form, even if the
shape of the wings was not altered; that is, to produce
individuals having the winter shape but the summer
markings. But this was not found to occur. Mr.
Edwards has been in the habit for several years of placing
the chrysalides in a warm room, or in the greenhouse, early
in the winter, thus causing the butterflies to emerge in
February, instead of in March and April, as otherwise
they would do. The heat in the house is 19° R. by day,
and not less than 3.5° R. by night. But the winter form
of the butterfly invariably emerged, usually <i>Telamonides</i>,
occasionally <i>Walshii</i>.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Experiments with Phyciodes Tharos.</span></h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Exp. 1.</span>&mdash;In July, 1875, eggs of <i>P. Tharos</i> were obtained
on <i>Aster Nova-Angliæ</i> in the Catskill Mountains, and
the young larvæ, when hatched, taken to Coalburgh,
West Virginia. On the journey the larvæ were fed on
various species of <i>Aster</i>, which they ate readily. By the
4th of September they had ceased feeding (after having
twice moulted), and slept. Two weeks later part of
them were again active, and fed for a day or two, when
they gathered in clusters and moulted for the third time,
then becoming lethargic, each one where it moulted with
the cast skin by its side. The larvæ were then placed
in a cellar, where they remained till February 7th, when
those that were alive were transferred to the leaves of an
<i>Aster</i> which had been forced in a greenhouse, and
some commenced to feed the same day. In due time
they moulted twice more, making, in some cases, a total
of five moults. On May 5th the first larva pupated,
and its butterfly emerged after thirteen days. Another
emerged on the 30th, after eight days pupal period,
this stage being shortened as the weather became
warmer. There emerged altogether 8 butterflies, 5 males<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
and 3 females, all of the form <i>Marcia</i>, and all of the
variety designated C, except 1 female, which was var.
<span class="locked">B.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Exp. 2.</span>&mdash;On May 18th the first specimens (3 male
<i>Marcia</i>) were seen on the wing at Coalburgh; 1 female
was taken on the 19th, 2 on the 23rd, and 2 on the
24th, these being all that were seen up to that date, but
shortly after both sexes became common. On the 26th,
7 females were captured and tied up in separate bags on
branches of <i>Aster</i>. The next day 6 out of the 7 had
laid eggs in clusters containing from 50 to 225 eggs in
each. Hundreds of caterpillars were obtained, each
brood being kept separate, and the butterflies began to
emerge on June 29th, the several stages being:&mdash;egg six
days, larva twenty-two, chrysalis five. Some of the
butterflies did not emerge till the 15th of July. Just
after this date one brood was taken to the Catskills,
where they pupated, and in this state were sent back to
Coalburgh. There was no difference in the length of
the different stages of this brood and the others which
had been left at Coalburgh, and none of either lot became
lethargic. The butterflies from these eggs of May
were all <i>Tharos</i>, with the exception of 1 female <i>Marcia</i>,
var. C. Thus the first generation of <i>Marcia</i> from the
hibernating larvæ furnishes a second generation of
<i>Tharos</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Exp. 3.</span>&mdash;On July 16th, at Coalburgh, eggs were obtained
from several females, all <i>Tharos</i>, as no other form
was flying. In four days the eggs hatched; the larval
stage was twenty-two, and the pupal stage seven days;
but, as before, many larvæ lingered. The first butterfly
emerged on August 18th. All were <i>Tharos</i>, and none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
of the larvæ had been lethargic. This was the third
generation from the second laying of eggs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Exp. 4.</span>&mdash;On August 15th, at Coalburgh, eggs were
obtained from a female <i>Tharos</i>, and then taken directly
to the Catskill Mountains, where they hatched on the
20th. This was the fourth generation from the third
laying of eggs. In Virginia, and during the journey, the
weather had been exceedingly warm, but on reaching the
mountains it was cool, and at night decidedly cold. September
was wet and cold, and the larvæ were protected
in a warm room at night and much of the time by day,
as they will not feed when the temperature is less than
about 8° R. The first pupa was formed September
15th, twenty-six days from the hatching of the larvæ,
and others at different dates up to September 26th, or
thirty-seven days from the egg. Fifty-two larvæ out of
127 became lethargic after the second moult on September
16th, and on September 26th fully one half of
these lethargic larvæ commenced to feed again, and
moulted for the third time, after which they became
again lethargic and remained in this state. The pupæ
from this batch were divided into three <span class="locked">portions:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>A. This lot was brought back to Coalburgh on October
15th, the weather during the journey having been
cold with several frosty nights, so that for a period of
thirty days the pupæ had at no time been exposed to
warmth. The butterflies began to emerge on the day
of arrival, and before the end of a week all that were
living had come forth, viz., 9 males and 10 females. “Of
these 9 males 4 were changed to <i>Marcia</i> var. C, 3 were
var. D, and 2 were not changed at all. Of the 10 females
8 were changed, 5 of them to var. B, 3 to var. C.
The other 2 females were not different from many
<i>Tharos</i> of the summer brood, having large discal patches
on under side of hind wing, besides the markings common
to the summer brood.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
B. This lot, consisting of 10 pupæ, was sent from
the Catskills to Albany, New York, where they were
kept in a cool place. Between October 21st and
Nov. 2nd, 6 butterflies emerged, all females, and all
of the var. B. Of the remaining pupæ 1 died, and 3
were alive on December 27th. According to Mr.
Edwards this species never hibernates in the pupal
state in nature. The butterflies of this lot were
more completely changed than were those from the
pupæ of lot A.</p>

<p>C. On September 20th 18 of the pupæ were placed
in a tin box directly on the surface of the ice, the temperature
of the house being 3°-4° R. Some were
placed in the box within three hours after transformation
and before they had hardened; others within six
hours, and others within nine hours. They were all
allowed to remain on the ice for seven days, that being
the longest summer period of the chrysalis. On being
removed they all appeared dead, being still soft, and
when they had become hard they had a shrivelled surface.
On being brought to Coalburgh they showed no
signs of life till October 21st, when the weather became
hot (24°-25° R.), and in two days 15 butterflies emerged,
“every one <i>Marcia</i>, not a doubtful form among them in
either sex.” Of these butterflies 10 were males and 5
females; of the former 5 were var. C, 4 var. D, and 1
var. B, and of the latter 1 was var. C, and 4 var. D.
The other 3 pupæ died. All the butterflies of this brood
were diminutive, starved by the cold, but those from the
ice were sensibly smaller than the others. All the examples
of var. B were more intense in the colouring
of the under surface than any ever seen by Mr.
Edwards in nature, and the single male was as deeply
coloured as the females, this also never occurring in
nature.</p>

<p>Mr. Edwards next proceeds to compare the behaviour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
of the Coalburgh broods with those of the same species
in the <span class="locked">Catskills:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Exp. 5.</span>&mdash;On arriving at the Catskills, on June 18th,
a few male <i>Marcia</i>, var. D, were seen flying, but no
females. This was exactly one month later than the
first males had been seen at Coalburgh. The first female
was taken on June 26th, another on June 27th, and
a third on the 28th, all <i>Marcia</i>, var. C. Thus the first
female was thirty-eight days later than the first at Coalburgh.
No more females were seen, and no <i>Tharos</i>.
The three specimens captured were placed on <i>Aster</i>,
where two immediately deposited <span class="locked">eggs<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></span> which were forwarded
to Coalburgh, where they hatched on July 3rd.
The first chrysalis was formed on the 20th, its butterfly
emerging on the 29th, so that the periods were: egg
six, larva seventeen, pupa nine days. Five per cent. of
the larvæ became lethargic after the second moult.
This was, therefore, the second generation of the butterfly
from the first laying of eggs. All the butterflies
which emerged were <i>Tharos</i>, the dark portions of the
wings being intensely black as compared with the Coalburgh
examples, and other differences of colour existed,
but the general peculiarities of the <i>Tharos</i> form were
retained. This second generation was just one month
behind the second at Coalburgh, and since, in 1875,
eggs were obtained by Mr. Mead on July 27th and
following days, the larvæ from which all hibernated,
this would be the second laying of eggs, and the
resulting butterflies the first generation of the following
season.</p>

<p>Thus in the Catskills the species is digoneutic, the
first generation being <i>Marcia</i> (the winter form), and the
second the summer form. A certain proportion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
larvæ from the first generation hibernate, and apparently
all those from the second.</p>

<p><i>Discussion of Results.</i>&mdash;There are four generations of
this butterfly at Coalburgh, the first being <i>Marcia</i> and
the second and third <i>Tharos</i>. None of the larvæ from
these were found to hibernate. The fourth generation
under the exceptional conditions above recorded (Exp.
4) produced some <i>Tharos</i> and more <i>Marcia</i> the same
season, a large proportion of the larvæ also hibernating.
Had the larvæ of this brood been kept at Coalburgh,
where the temperature remained high for several weeks
after they had left the egg, the resulting butterflies
would have been all <i>Tharos</i>, and the larvæ from their
eggs would have hibernated.</p>

<p>The altitude of the Catskills, where Mr. Edwards was,
is from 1650 to 2000 feet above high water, and the altitude
of Coalburgh is 600 feet. The transference of the
larvæ from the Catskills to Virginia (about 48° lat.) and
<i>vice-versa</i>, besides the difference of altitude, had no perceptible
influence on the butterflies of the several broods
except the last one, in which the climatic change exerted
a direct influence on part of them both as to form and
size. The stages of the June Catskill brood may have
been accelerated to a small extent by transference to
Virginia, but the butterflies reserved their peculiarities
of colour. (See Exp. <a href="#P1-A1">5</a>.) So also was the habit of
lethargy <span class="locked">retained.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></span> The May brood, on the other hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
taken from Virginia to the Catskills, suffered no retardation
of development. (See Exp. <a href="#P1-A1">2</a>.) It might have
been expected that all the larvæ of this last brood taken
to the mountains would have become lethargic, but the
majority resisted this change of habit. From all these
facts it may be concluded “that it takes time to naturalize
a stranger, and that habits and tendencies, even in a
butterfly, are not to be changed <span class="locked">suddenly.”<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></span></p>

<p>It has been shown that <i>Tharos</i> is digoneutic in the
Catskills and polygoneutic in West Virginia, so that at
a great altitude, or in a high latitude, we might expect
to find the species monogoneutic and probably restricted
to the winter form <i>Marcia</i>. These conditions are fulfilled
in the Island of Anticosti, and on the opposite
coast of Labrador (about lat. 50°), the summer temperature
of these districts being about the same. Mr. Edwards
states, on the authority of Mr. Cooper, who collected
in the Island, that <i>Tharos</i> is a rare species there,
but has a wide distribution. No specimens were seen
later than July 29, after which date the weather became
cold, and very few butterflies of any sort were to be seen.
It seems probable that none of the butterflies of Anticosti
or Labrador produce a second brood. All the
specimens examined from these districts were of the
winter form.</p>

<p>In explanation of the present case Dr. Weismann
wrote to Mr. Edwards:&mdash;“<i>Marcia</i> is the old primary
form of the species, in the glacial period the only one.
<i>Tharos</i> is the secondary form, having arisen in the
course of many generations through the gradually working
influence of summer heat. In your experiments
cold has caused the summer generation to revert to the
primary form. The reversion which occurred was complete
in the females, but not in all the males. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
proves, as it appears to me, that the males are changed
or affected more strongly by the heat of summer than
the females. The secondary form has a stronger constitution
in the males than in the females. As I read
your letter, it at once occurred to me whether in the
spring there would not appear some males which were
not pure <i>Marcia</i>, but were of the summer form, or nearly
resembling it; and when I reached the conclusion of
the letter I found that you especially mentioned that
this was so! And I was reminded that the same thing
is observable in <i>A. Levana</i>, though in a less striking degree.
If we treated the summer brood of <i>Levana</i> with
ice, many more females than males would revert to the
winter form. This sex is more conservative than the
male&mdash;slower to change.”</p>

<p>The extreme variability of <i>P. Tharos</i> was alluded to
more than a century ago by Drury, who stated:&mdash;“In
short, Nature forms such a variety of this species that it
is difficult to set bounds, or to know all that belongs to
it.” Of the different named varieties, according to Mr.
Edwards, “A appears to be an offset of B, in the direction
most remote from the summer form, just as in
<i>Papilio Ajax</i>, the var. <i>Walshii</i> is on the further side of
<i>Telamonides</i>, remote from the summer form <i>Marcellus</i>.”
Var. C leads from B through D directly to the summer
form, whilst A is more unlike this last variety than are
several distinct species of the genus, and would not be
suspected to possess any close relationship were it not
for the intermediate forms. The var. B is regarded as
nearest to the primitive type for the following reasons:&mdash;In
the first place it is the commonest form, predominating
over all the other varieties in W. Virginia, and
moreover appears constantly in the butterflies from
pupæ submitted to refrigeration. Its distinctive peculiarity
of colour occurs in the allied species <i>P. Phaon</i>
(Gulf States) and <i>P. Vesta</i> (Texas), both of which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
seasonally dimorphic, and both apparently restricted in
their winter broods to the form corresponding to B of
<i>Tharos</i>. In their summer generation both these species
closely resemble the summer form of <i>Tharos</i>, and it is
remarkable that these two species, which are the only
ones (with the exception of the doubtful <i>Batesii</i>) closely
allied to <i>Tharos</i>, should alone be seasonally dimorphic
out of the large number of species in the genus.</p>

<p>Mr. Edwards thus explains the case under consideration:&mdash;“When
<i>Phaon</i>, <i>Vesta</i>, and <i>Tharos</i> were as yet
only varieties of one species, the sole coloration was that
now common to the three. As they gradually became
permanent, or in other words, as these varieties became
species, <i>Tharos</i> was giving rise to several sub-varieties,
some of them in time to become distinct and well
marked, while the other two, <i>Phaon</i> and <i>Vesta</i>, remained
constant. As the climate moderated and the summer
became longer, each species came to have a summer
generation; and in these the resemblance of blood-relationship
is still manifest. As the winter generations
of each species had been much alike, so the summer
generations which sprung from them were much alike.
And if we consider the metropolis of the species <i>Tharos</i>,
or perhaps of its parent species, at the time when it had
but one annual generation, to have been somewhere between
37° and 40° on the Atlantic slope, and within
which limits all the varieties and sub-varieties of both
winter and summer forms of <i>Tharos</i> are now found in
amazing luxuriance, we can see how it is possible, as the
glacial cold receded, that only part of the varieties of
the winter form might spread to the northward, and but
one of them at last reach the sub-boreal regions and
hold possession to this day as the sole representative of
the species. And at a very early period the primary
form, together with <i>Phaon</i> and <i>Vesta</i>, had made its way
southward, where all three are found now.”</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Experiments with Grapta Interrogationis.</span><a name="FNanchor_64a" id="FNanchor_64a" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor notbold">64</a></h5>

<p class="center">[<i>Communicated by</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">W. H. EDWARDS</span>, <i>November 15th, 1879</i>.]</p>

<p>The experiments with this species were made in June,
1879, on pupæ from eggs laid by the summer form
<i>Umbrosa</i> of the second brood of the year, and obtained
by confining a female in a bag on a stem of hop. As
the pupæ formed, and at intervals of from six to twenty-four
hours after pupation (by which time all the older
ones had fully hardened), they were placed in the ice-box.
In making this experiment Mr. Edwards had
three objects in view. 1st. To see whether it was essential
that the exposure should take place immediately
after pupation, in order to effect any change. 2ndly.
To see how short a period would suffice to bring about
any change. 3rdly. Whether exposing the summer
pupæ would bring about a change in the form of the
resulting butterfly. Inasmuch as breeding from the egg
of <i>Umbrosa</i>, in June, in a former <span class="locked">year,<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></span> gave both <i>Umbrosa</i>
(11) and <i>Fabricii</i> (6), the butterflies from the eggs
obtained, if left to nature, might be expected to be of
both forms. The last or fourth brood of the year having
been found up to the present time to be <i>Fabricii</i>, and the
1st brood of the spring, raised from eggs of <i>Fabricii</i> (laid
in confinement), having been found to be wholly <i>Umbrosa</i>,
the latter is probably the summer and <i>Fabricii</i> the
winter form. The two intervening broods, <i>i.e.</i> the 2nd
and 3rd, have yielded both forms. This species hibernates
in the imago state.</p>

<p>After the pupæ had been in the ice-box fourteen days
they were all removed but 5, which were left in six days
longer. Several were dead at the end of fourteen days.
The temperature most of the time was 1°-2° R.; but for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
a few hours each day rose as the ice melted, and was
found to be 3°-6° R.</p>

<p>From the fourteen-day lot 7 butterflies were obtained,
3 males and 4 females. From the twenty-day lot 4
males and 1 female; every one <i>Umbrosa</i>. All had
changed in one striking particular. In the normal <i>Umbrosa</i>
of both <span class="locked">sexes,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></span> the fore wings have on the upper
side on the costal margin next inside the hind marginal
border, and separated from it by a considerable fulvous
space, a dark patch which ends a little below the discoidal
nervule; inside the same border at the inner
angle is another dark patch lying on the submedian
interspace. Between these two patches, across all the
median interspaces, the ground-colour is fulvous, very
slightly clouded with dark.</p>

<p>In all the 4 females exposed to cold for fourteen
days a broad black band appeared crossing the whole
wing, continuous, of uniform shade, covering the two
patches, and almost confluent from end to end with the
marginal border, only a streak of obscure fulvous anywhere
separating the two. In the case of the females
from pupæ exposed for twenty days, the band was
present, but while broad, and covering the space between
the patches, it was not so dark as in the other
females, and included against the border a series of
obscure fulvous lunules. This is just like many normal
females, and this butterfly was essentially unchanged.</p>

<p>In all the males the patches were diffuse, that at the
apex almost coalescing with the border. In the 3
from chrysalides exposed fourteen days these patches
were connected by a narrow dark band (very different
from the broad band of the females), occupying the same
position as the clouding of the normal male, but
blackened and somewhat diffused. In the 4 examples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
from the twenty-day pupæ, this connecting band was
scarcely as deeply coloured and continuous as in the
other 3. Beyond this change on the submarginal area,
whereby a band is created where naturally would be
only the two patches, and a slight clouding of the intervening
fulvous surfaces, there was no difference of the
upper surface apparent between these examples of both
sexes, and a long series of natural ones placed beside
them.</p>

<p>On the under side all the males were of one type, the
colours being very intense. There was considerably
more red, both dark and pale, over the whole surface,
than in a series of natural examples in which shades of
brown and a bluish hue predominate. No change was
observed in the females on the under side.</p>

<p>It appears that fourteen days were as effective in producing
changes as a longer period. In fact, the most
decided changes were found in the females exposed the
shorter period. It also appears that with this species
cold will produce change if applied after the chrysalis
has hardened. The same experiments were attempted
in 1878 with pupæ of <i>Grapta Comma</i>. They were put
on ice at from ten minutes to six hours after forming,
and subjected to a temperature of about 0°-1° R. for
eighteen to twenty days, but every pupa was killed.
Chrysalides of <i>Papilio Ajax</i> in the same box, and
partly exposed very soon after pupation, were not
injured. It was for this reason that none of the
<i>Interrogationis</i> pupæ were placed in the box till six
hours had passed.</p>

<p>It appears further that cold may change the markings
on one part of the wing only, and in cases where it does
change dark or dusky markings melanises them; or it
may deepen the colours of the under surface (as in the
females of the present experiment). The females in
the above experiment were apparently most susceptible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
to the cold, the most decided changes having been
effected in them.</p>

<p>The resulting butterflies were all of one form, although
both might have been expected to appear under natural
circumstances.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Weismann’s remarks on the foregoing experiments.</i>&mdash;The
author of the present work has, at my request,
been good enough to furnish the following remarks upon
Mr. Edward’s experiments with <i>G. Interrogationis</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>The interesting experiments of Mr. Edwards are here
principally introduced because they show how many
weighty questions in connexion with seasonal dimorphism
still remain to be solved. The present experiments do
not offer a <i>direct</i> but, at most, only an <i>indirect</i> proof of the
truth of my theory, since they show that the explanation
opposed to mine is also in this case inadmissible. Thus
we have here, as with <i>Papilio Ajax</i>, two out of the four
annual generations mixed, <i>i.e.</i>, consisting of summer and
winter forms, and the conclusion is inevitable that these
forms were not produced by the <i>gradual</i> action of heat
or cold. When, from pupæ of the same generation
which are developed under precisely the same external
conditions, both forms of the butterfly are produced, the
cause of their diversity cannot lie in these conditions.
It must rather depend on causes innate in the organism
itself, <i>i.e.</i>, on inherited duplicating tendencies which
meet in the same generation, and to a certain extent
contend with each other for precedence. The two forms
must have had their origin in earlier generations, and
there is nothing against the view that they have arisen
through the gradual augmentation of the influences of
temperature.</p>

<p>In another sense, however, one might perceive, in the
facts discovered by Edwards, an objection to my theory.</p>

<p>By the action of cold the form <i>Umbrosa</i>, which flies in
June, was produced. Now we should be inclined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
regard the var. <i>Umbrosa</i> as the summer form, and the
var. <i>Fabricii</i>, which emerges in the autumn, hibernates in
the imago state, and lays eggs in the spring, as the
winter form. It would then be incomprehensible why
the var. <i>Umbrosa</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, the summer form) should be produced
by cold.</p>

<p>But it is quite as possible that the var. <i>Umbrosa</i> as
that the var. <i>Fabricii</i> is the winter form. We must not
forget that, in this species, <i>not one of the four annual
generations is exposed to the cold of winter in the pupal
state</i>. When, therefore, we have in such cases seasonal
dimorphism, to which complete certainty can only be
given by continued observations of this butterfly, which
does not occur very commonly in Virginia, this must
depend on the fact that the species formerly hibernated
in the pupal stage. This question now arises, which of
the existing generations was formerly the hibernating
one&mdash;the first or the last?</p>

<p>Either may have done so <i>à priori</i>, according as the
summer was formerly shorter or longer than now for
this species. If the former were the case, the var. <i>Fabricii</i>
is the older winter form; were the latter the case,
the var. <i>Umbrosa</i> is the original winter form, as shall
now be more closely established.</p>

<p>Should the experiments which Mr. Edwards has performed
in the course of his interesting investigations be
repeated in future with always the same results, I should
be inclined to explain the case as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It is not the var. <i>Fabricii</i>, but <i>Umbrosa</i>, which is the
winter generation. By the northward migration of the
species and the relative shortening of the summer, this
winter generation would be pushed forward into the
summer, and would thereby lose only a portion of the
winter characters which it had till that time possessed.
The last of the four generations which occurs in Virginia
is extremely rare, so that it must be regarded either as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
one of the generations now supposed to be originating,
or as one now supposed to be disappearing. The
latter may be admitted. Somewhat further north this
generation would be entirely suppressed, and the third
brood would hibernate, either in the imago state or as
pupæ or caterpillars. In Virginia this third generation
consists of both forms. We may expect that further
north, at least, where it hibernates as pupæ, it will consist
entirely, or almost entirely, of the var. <i>Umbrosa</i>. Still
further north in the Catskill Mountains, as Edwards
states from his own observations, the species has only two
generations, and one might expect that the var. <i>Umbrosa</i>
would there occur as the winter generation.</p>

<p>Should the foregoing be correct, then the fact that the
second generation assumes the <i>Umbrosa</i> form by the
action of cold, as was the case in Edward’s experiments,
becomes explicable. The new marking peculiar to this
form produced by this means must be regarded as a complete
reversion to the true winter form, the characters
of which are becoming partly lost as this generation is
no longer exposed to the influence of winter, but has
become advanced to the beginning of summer.</p>

<p><i>The foregoing explanation is, of course, purely hypothetical</i>;
it cannot at present be asserted that it is the correct
one. Many investigations based on a sufficiently large
number of facts are still necessary to be able to attempt
to explain this complicated case with any certainty.
Neither should I have ventured to offer any opinion on
the present case, did I not believe that even such a premature
and entirely uncertain explanation may always
be of use in serving the inventive principle, <i>i.e.</i>, in
pointing out the way in which the truth must be
sought.</p>

<p>As far as I know, no attempt has yet been made to
prove from a general point of view the interpolation of
new generations, or the omission of single generations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
from the annual cycle, with respect to causes and effects.
An investigation of this kind would be of the greatest
importance, not only for seasonal dimorphism, but also
for the elucidation of questions of a much more general
nature, and would be a most satisfactory problem for the
scientific entomologist. I may here be permitted to
develope in a purely theoretical manner the principles in
accordance with which such an investigation should be
<span class="locked">made:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>On the change in the number of generations of the annual
cycle.</i>&mdash;A change in the number of generations which a
species produces annually must be sought chiefly in
changes of climate, and therefore in a lengthening or
shortening of the period of warmth, or in an increase or
diminution of warmth within this period; or, finally, in
both changes conjointly. The last case would be of the
most frequent occurrence, since a lengthening of the
period of warmth is, as a rule, correlated with an elevation
of the mean temperature of this period, and <i>vice
versâ</i>. Of other complications I can here perceive the
<span class="locked">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Climatic changes may be <i>active</i> or <i>passive</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, they
occur by a change of climate or by a migration and extension
of the species over new districts having another
climate.</p>

<p>By a lengthening of the summer, as I shall designate
the shorter portion of the whole annual period of warmth,
the last generation of the year would be advanced further
in its development than before; if, for instance, it
formerly hibernated in the pupal state, it would now
pass the winter in the imago stage. Should a further
lengthening of the summer occur, the butterflies might
emerge soon enough to lay eggs in the autumn, and by
a still greater lengthening the eggs also might hatch, the
larvæ grow up and hibernate as pupæ. In this manner
we should have a new generation interpolated, owing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
the generation which formerly hibernated being made
to recede step by step towards the autumn and the
summer. <i>By a lengthening of the summer there occurs
therefore a retrogressive interruption of generations.</i></p>

<p>The exact opposite occurs if the summer should become
shortened. In this case the last generation would no
longer be so far developed as formerly; for instance, it
might not reach the pupal stage, as formerly, at the beginning
of winter, and would thus hibernate in a younger
stage, either as egg or larvæ. Finally, by a continual
shortening of the summer it would no longer appear at
the end of this period but in the following spring; in
other words, it would be eliminated. <i>By a shortening of
the summer accordingly the interruption of generations
occurs by advancement.</i></p>

<p>The following considerations, which submit themselves
with reference to seasonal dimorphism, are readily conceivable,
at least, in so far as they can be arrived at by
purely theoretical methods. Were the summer to become
shorter the generation which formerly hibernated
in the pupal stage would be advanced further into the
spring. It would not thereby necessarily immediately
lose the winter characters which it formerly possessed.
Whether this would happen, and to what extent, would
rather depend upon the intensity of the action of the
summer climate on the generation in question, and on
the number of generations which have been submitted
to this action. Hitherto no attempts have been made
to expose a monomorphic species to an elevated temperature
throughout several generations, so as to obtain
an approximate measure of the rapidity with which
such climatic influences can bring about changes. For
this reason we must for the present refrain from all
hypothesis relating to this subject.</p>

<p>The disturbance of generations by the shortening of
summer might also occur to a species in such a manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
that the generation which formerly hibernated advances
into the spring, the last of the summer generations at
the same time reaching the beginning of winter. The
latter would then hibernate in the pupal state, and would
sooner or later also assume the winter form through the
action of the cold of winter. We should, in this case,
have two generations possessing more or less completely
the winter form, the ancient winter generation now
gradually losing the winter characters, and the new winter
generation gradually acquiring these characters.</p>

<p>In the reverse case, <i>i.e.</i>, by a lengthening of the summer,
we should have the same possibilities only with the
difference that the disturbance of generations would
occur in a reverse direction. In this case it might
happen that the former winter generation would
become the autumnal brood, and more or less preserve
its characters for a long period. Here also a new
winter generation would be produced as soon as the
former spring brood had so far retrograded that its
pupæ hibernated.</p>

<p>I am only too conscious how entirely theoretical are
these conjectures. It is very possible that observation
of nature will render numerous corrections necessary.
For instance, I have assumed that every species is able,
when necessary, to adapt any one of its developmental
stages to hibernation. Whether this is actually the case
must be learnt from further researches; at present we
only know that many species hibernate in the egg stage,
others in the larval state, others as pupæ, and yet others
in the perfect state. We know also that many species
hibernate in several stages at the same time, but we do
not know whether each stage of every species has an
equal power of accommodation to cold. Should this not
be the case the above conjectures would have to be considerably
modified. To take up this subject, so as to
completely master all the facts connected therewith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
naturalists would have to devote their whole time and
energy to the order Lepidoptera, which I have been
unable to do.</p>

<p>From the considerations offered, it thus appears that
the phenomena of seasonal dimorphism may depend on
extremely complex processes, so that one need not be
surprised if only a few cases now admit of certain
analysis. We must also admit, however, that it is more
advantageous to science to be able in the first place to
analyze the simplest cases by means of breeding experiments,
than to concern oneself in guessing at cases
which are so complicated as to make it impossible at
present to procure all the materials necessary for their
solution.</p>

<h4 id="P2-1-INTRO">INTRODUCTION.</h4>

<p>The general idea which has instigated the researches
described in the present essay has
already been expressed in the Preface, where it
has also been explained why the markings of
caterpillars, and especially those of the Sphinx-larvæ,
were chosen for testing this idea.</p>

<p>The task presented itself in the following
form:&mdash;In order to test the idea referred to, it
must be investigated whether all the forms of
marking which occur in the Sphinx-larvæ can or
cannot be traced to known transforming factors.</p>

<p>That natural selection produces a large number
of characters can be as little doubted as that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
many varying external influences can bring about
changes in an organism by direct action. That
these two transforming factors, together with
their correlatively induced changes, are competent
to produce <i>all</i> characters, howsoever insignificant,
has indeed been truly asserted, but has never yet
been proved. The solution of the problem, however,
appeared to me to depend particularly on this
point. We are now no longer concerned in proving
that a changing environment reacts upon the
organism&mdash;this has already been shown&mdash;but we
have to deal with the question whether <i>every
change</i> is the result of the action of the environment
upon the organism. Were it possible to
trace all the forms of markings which occur, to
one of the known factors of species transformation,
it could be thus shown that here at least an
“innate power of development” was of no effect;
were this not possible, <i>i.e.</i> did there remain
residual markings which could not be explained,
then the notion of an “innate principle of development”
could not be at once entirely discountenanced.</p>

<p>The attempt to solve this problem should commence
by the acquisition of a morphological
groundwork, so that the phyletic development of
the markings might by this means be represented
as far as possible. It cannot be stated with certainty,
<i>primâ facie</i>, whether some form of development
conformable to law is here to be found,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
but it soon becomes manifest that such is certainly
the case in a great measure. In all species the
young caterpillars are differently marked to the
adults, and in many the markings change with
each of the five stages of growth indicated by the
four ecdyses, this gradational transformation of
the markings being a “development” in the true
sense of the word, <i>i.e.</i>, an origination of the complex
from the simple, the development of characters
from those previously in existence, and never an
inconstant, unconnected series of <i>per saltum</i>
changes. This development of the markings in
individuals very well reveals their phyletic development,
since there can be no doubt but that
we have here preserved to us in the ontogeny, as
I shall establish more fully further on, a very
slightly altered picture of the phyletic development.
The latter can have been but slightly
“falsified” in these cases, although it is indeed
considerably abbreviated, and that in very different
degrees; to the greatest extent in those species
which are most advanced in their phyletic development,
and to the least extent in those which
are less advanced. From this the value of being
able to compare a large number of species with
respect to their ontogeny will appear. Unfortunately,
however, this has only been possible to a
very limited extent.</p>

<p>The youngest larval stages are those which
are of the most importance for revealing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
phyletic development, because they make us acquainted
with the markings of the progenitors of
the existing species. For these investigations it
is therefore in the first place necessary to obtain
fertile eggs. Female <i>Sphingidæ</i>, however, do not
generally lay eggs in <span class="locked">confinement,<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></span> or at most
only a very small number. In the case of many
species (<i>Deilephila Galii</i>, <i>D. Lineata</i>, <i>D. Vespertilio</i>,
<i>D. Hippophaës</i>) I have for this reason unfortunately
been unable to observe the entire
development, and such observations would in all
probability have given especially valuable information.</p>

<p>I was certainly successful in finding the young
larvæ of some of the above as well as of other
species on their food-plants, but even in the most
favourable instances only individuals of the second
stage and generally older. When, however, notwithstanding
this imperfection of the materials,
and in spite of the important gaps thus inevitably
caused in these series of observations, it has
nevertheless been possible to form a picture, on
the whole tolerably complete, of the phyletic development
of the Sphinx-markings, this well indicates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
what a fertile field is offered by the investigation
of this subject, and will, I trust, furnish
an inducement to others, not only to fill up the
various gaps in the small family of the <i>Sphingidæ</i>,
but also to treat other Lepidopterous
families in a similar manner. Such an investigation
of the <i>Papilionidæ</i> appears to me to be
especially desirable; not only of the few European
but also of the American and Indian species. We
know practically nothing, of the youngest stages
of the <i>Papilio</i> larvæ from this point of view. No
entomological work gives any description of the
form and marking of the newly hatched larvæ,
even in the case of our commonest species (<i>Papilio
Machaon</i> and <i>P. Podalirius</i>), and I believe that
I do not go too far when I assert that up to the
present time nobody has observed them at this
early <span class="locked">stage.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></span> When, however, we consider that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
in these young caterpillars we have preserved to
us the parent-form, extinct for centuries, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
existing species of <i>Papilio</i>, it must assuredly be
of the greatest interest to become accurately acquainted
with them, to compare them with the
earliest stages of allied species, and to follow the
gradual divergence of the succeeding stages in
different directions, thus forming a picture of the
phyletic development of an evolving group. In
the course of such observations numerous collateral
results would doubtless come out. Investigations
of this kind, whether conducted on this
or on any other group, would, above all, show the
true systematic affinities of the forms, <i>i.e.</i>, their
<i>genealogical</i> affinities, and that in a better way
than could be shown by the morphology of the
perfect insects or the adult caterpillars alone. If
I am diffident in founding these conclusions upon
the development of the Sphinx-markings treated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
of in the present essay, this arises entirely from a
knowledge of the imperfections in the basis of
facts. If however, through the united labours of
many investigators, the individual development
of all the species of <i>Sphingidæ</i> now existing should
at some future period be clearly laid before us,
we should then not only have arrived at a knowledge
of the relative ages of the different species,
genera and families, but we should also arrive at
an explanation of the nature of their affinities.</p>

<p>It is erroneous to assert that Classification has
only to take form-relationship into consideration;
that it should and can be nothing else than the
expression of form-relationship. The latter is
certainly our only measure of blood-relationship,
but those who maintain the assertion that form-
and blood-relationship are by no means always
synonymous, are undoubtedly correct. I shall in
a future essay adduce facts which leave no doubt
on this point, and which prove at the same time
that modern systematists&mdash;especially in the order
Lepidoptera&mdash;have always endeavoured&mdash;although
quite unconsciously&mdash;to make the blood-relationship
the basis of their classification. For this
reason alone, larvæ and pupæ would have an
important bearing upon the establishment of systematic
groups, although certainly in a manner
frequently irregular.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that so long as we are
able to compare the species of one group with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
those of another <i>in one form only</i>, we are often
unable to ascertain the <span class="locked">blood-relationship.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></span> In
such cases we can only determine the latter from
the form-relationship, and as these are not always
parallel, any conclusion based on a single form
must be very unsound. If, for instance, butterflies
emerged from the egg directly, without passing
through any larval stage, a comparison of their
resemblances of form would alone be of systematic
value; we should unite them into groups on the
ground of these resemblances only, and the
formation of these groups would then much depend
upon the weight assigned to this or that
character. We might thus fall into error, not
only through a different valuation of characters
but still more because two species of near blood-relationship
frequently differ from one another in
form to a greater extent than from other species.
We should have no warrant that our conception of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
the form-relationship expressed the genealogical
connection of the species. But it would be quite
different if every species presented itself in two or
three different forms. If in two species or genera
the butterflies as well as the larvæ and pupæ exhibited
the same degree of form-relationship, the
probability that this expressed also the blood-relationship
would then be exceedingly great.
Now this agreement certainly does not always
occur, and when these different stages are related
in form in unequal degrees, the problem
then is to decide which of these relationships
expresses the genealogy. This decision may be
difficult to arrive at in single cases, since the caterpillar
may diverge in form from the next blood-related
species to a greater extent than the butterfly,
or, conversely, the butterfly may diverge more
widely from its nearest blood-related species than
the caterpillar.</p>

<p>For such cases there remains the developmental
history of the caterpillar, which will almost
always furnish us to a certain extent with information
respecting the true genealogical relationship
of the forms, because it always reveals a
portion of the phyletic (ancestral) development of
the species. If we see two species of butterflies
quite dissimilar in form of wing and other characters,
we should be inclined, in spite of many points
of agreement between them, to place them in
entirely different genera. But should we then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
find that not only did their adult larvæ agree in
every detail of marking, but also that the entire
phyletic development of these markings, as revealed
by the ontogeny of the larvæ, had taken
precisely the same course in both species, we
should certainly conclude that they possessed a
near blood-relationship, and should place them
close together in the same genus. Such an instance
is afforded by the two Hawk-moths, <i>Chærocampa
Elpenor</i> and <i>C. Porcellus</i>, as will appear in
the course of these investigations. These two
species were placed by Walker in different genera,
the form-relationship of the imagines being thus
correctly represented, since <i>Porcellus</i> (imago), is
indeed more nearly related in form to the species
of the genus <i>Pergesa</i>, Walker, than to those of the
genus <i>Chærocampa</i>.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> Nevertheless, these species
must remain in the same genus, as no other arrangement
expresses their degree of blood-relationship.</p>

<p>An intimate knowledge of the development-stages
of caterpillars thus offers, even from a systematic
point of view, an invaluable means of
judging the degree of blood-relationship, and from
this standpoint we must regard the study of the
caterpillar as of more importance than that of the
perfect insect. Certainly all groups would not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
so rich in information as the <i>Sphingidæ</i>, or, as I
am inclined to believe, the <i>Papilionidæ</i>, since all
families of caterpillars do not possess such a
marked and diversified pattern, nor do they present
such a varied and characteristic bodily form. The
representation of the true, <i>i.e.</i>, the blood-relationship,
and through this the formation of natural
groups with any completeness, can certainly only
be looked for when we are intimately acquainted
with the different stages of development of the
larvæ of numerous species in every group, from
their emergence from the egg to their period of
pupation. The genealogical relationship of many
forms at present of doubtful systematic position
would then be made clear. This investigation,
however, could not be the work of a single individual;
not only because the materials for observation
are too great, but, above all, because they are
spread over too wide a field. It is not sufficient
to study the European types only&mdash;we should
endeavour to learn as much as possible of the
Lepidoptera of the whole world. But such observations
can only be made on the spot. Why
should it not be possible to trace the development
from the egg, even under a tropical sky, and to
devote to breeding and observing, a portion of that
time which is generally spent in mere collecting?
I may perhaps be able to convince some of the
many excellent and careful observers among entomologists,
that beyond the necessary and valuable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
search for new forms, there is another field which
may be successfully worked, viz., the precise investigation
of the development of known species.</p>

<p>The first portion of the present essay consists
of the determination of this development in those
species of <i>Sphingidæ</i> which have been accessible
to me. Seven genera are successively treated of,
some completely, and others only in some of their
stages; and thus I have sought to present a picture
of the course of development of the markings in
each genus, by comparing the species with each
other, and with allied forms in cases where the
young stages were unknown. In this portion, as
far as possible, the facts only have been given, the
working up of the latter into general conclusions
upon the development of marking being reserved
for the second portion. A complete separation of
facts from generalizations could not, however, be
carried out; it appeared convenient to close the
account of each genus with a summary of the
results obtained from the various species.</p>

<p>After having established that the markings of
the Sphinx-caterpillars had undergone an extremely
gradual phyletic development, conformable
to law, in certain fixed directions, it appeared
desirable to investigate the causes of the first
appearance of these markings, as well as of their
subsequent development. The question as to the
biological significance of marking here presented
itself in the first place for solution, and the third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
section is devoted to this subject. If it is maintained
that marking is of no importance to the life
of the insect, or that it is so only exceptionally, and
that it is in reality, as it appears to be, a character
of purely morphological, <i>i.e.</i>, physiological, insignificance,
then its striking phylogenetic development
conformable to law cannot be explained by
any of the known factors of species transformation,
and we should have to assume the action of an
innate transforming power. In the present investigations,
this subject in particular has been extensively
treated of, and not only the markings of
Sphinx-caterpillars, but also those of caterpillars in
general, have been taken into consideration. The
results arrived at are indeed quite opposed to this
assumption&mdash;marking is shown to be a character
of extreme importance to the life of the species,
and the admission of a phyletic vital force must,
at least from the present point of view, be excluded.
This leads to the fifth section, in which I have attempted
to test certain objections to the admission
of a “phyletic vital force.” The sixth section
finally gives a summary of the results obtained.</p>

<p>I may now add a few explanations which are
necessary for understanding the subsequent descriptions.
It was found impossible to avoid the
introduction of some new technicalities for describing
the various elements of larval markings,
especially as the latter had to be treated of scientifically.
I have therefore chosen the simplest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
and most obvious designations, all of which have
already been employed by various authors, but not
in any rigorously defined sense. I understand
by the “dorsal line” that which runs down the
middle of the back; the lines above and below the
spiracles will be respectively distinguished as the
“supra-” and “infra-spiracular” lines, and the
line between the dorsal and spiracular as the “subdorsal
line.” The distinction between “ring-spots”
and “eye-spots” will be made manifest in
the course of the investigation. A glance at any
of the existing descriptions of larvæ will show how
necessary it was to introduce a precise terminology.
Even when the latter is exact as far as it goes,
the want of precise expressions not only makes
the descriptions unnecessarily long, but it also
considerably increases the difficulty of comparing
one species with another, since we can never be
sure whether the same designation applies to the
same homologous character. For instance, when
the larva of <i>Chærocampa Elpenor</i> is said to have
“a light longitudinal line on the sides of the
thoracic segments,” this statement is indeed correct;
but it is not apparent whether the line is above or
below, and consequently it does not appear
whether it is the equivalent of the longitudinal
line “on the sides” of the segments in other
species. If, however, it is said that this line is
“<i>subdorsal</i> on the thoracic segments, and on the
eleventh abdominal segment,” it is thereby indicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
that we have here a residue of the same marking
which is found completely developed in many other
Sphinx-larvæ, and indeed in the young stages of
this same species. The mode of describing caterpillars
hitherto in vogue is in fact unscientific; the
descriptions have not been made with a view to
determining the <i>morphology</i> of the larvæ, but
simply to meet the practical want of being able to
readily identify any species that may be found:
even for this purpose, however, it would have
been better to have employed a more precise
mode of description.</p>

<h5>THE GENUS CHÆROCAMPA, DUPONCHEL.</h5>

<p>Although by no means in favour of the excessive
subdivision of genera, I am of opinion that
Ochsenheimer’s genus <i>Deilephila</i> has been
correctly separated by Duponchel into the two
genera <i>Chærocampa</i> and <i>Deilephila</i>, <i>sensû strictiori</i>.
Such a division may appear but little necessary
if we examine the perfect insects only; but the
developmental history of the caterpillars shows
that there is a wide division between the two
groups of species, these groups however being
branches of one stem.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Chærocampa Elpenor</span>, <span class="smcap">Linn.</span></h6>

<p>Some captured females laid single eggs sparsely
on grass, wood, and especially on the tarlatan with
which the breeding-cage was covered. The eggs
are nearly spherical, but somewhat compressed,
of a grass-green colour, a little lighter, and somewhat
larger (1.2 millim.) than those of <i>Deilephila
Euphorbiæ</i>. During the development of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
embryo the eggs first became yellowish-green, and
finally yellowish.</p>

<p class="h7"><i>First Stage.</i></p>

<p>The young caterpillars are four millimeters in
length, and immediately after hatching are not
green, but of a yellowish-white opalescent colour,
the large and somewhat curved caudal horn being
black. The caterpillars were so transparent that
under a low magnifying power the nervous,
tracheal, and alimentary systems could be beautifully
seen. As soon as the larvæ began to feed
(on <i>Epilobium parviflorum</i>) they became green in
consequence of the food appearing through the
skin, but the latter also gradually acquired a dark
green colour (<a href="#Plate_IV">Pl. IV</a>., Fig. 17). All the specimens
(some twenty in number) were exactly alike, and
showed <i>no trace of marking</i>.</p>

<p class="h7"><i>Second Stage.</i></p>

<p>The first ecdysis occurred after 5&ndash;6 days, the
length of the caterpillars being from nine to ten
millimeters. After this first moult they appeared
of a shining green, the horn, which was black
during the first stage, becoming a little red at the
base, while a fine white subdorsal line extended
from the horn to the head (<a href="#Plate_IV">Fig. 18</a>). The head
and legs were green; the divisions between the
segments appeared as fine light rings, and the
entire upper surface of the segments was also crossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
by fine transverse rings, as was also the case in the
first stage.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the present stage no trace
of the eye-spots could be detected; but a few days
after the first moult it was observed that the white
subdorsal line was no longer straight on the fourth
and fifth segments, but had become curved upwards
into two small crescents. The latter soon stood
out more strongly, owing to the filling up of their
concavities with darker green. These are the
first rudiments of the eye-spots (<a href="#Plate_IV">Figs. 19 and 30</a>).
A very fine white line now connected the spiracles
(infra-spiracular line), and could be traced from
the last segment to the head. This line takes
no further part in the subsequent development of
the markings, but disappears in the following
stage. The blood-red colour of the base of the
black caudal horn is retained till the fifth stage,
and then also disappears.</p>

<p>Before the second moult, which occurs after
another period of 5&ndash;6 days, the caterpillars, which
were about 1.3 centimeters in length, had assumed
their characteristic tapering, slug-like form. I did
not notice that the larvæ at this stage possessed
the power of withdrawing the three foremost
segments into the two succeeding ones, as is so
frequently to be observed in the adults; neither
were these two segments so strikingly enlarged as
they are at an earlier period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span></p>

<p class="h7"><i>Third Stage.</i></p>

<p>After the second ecdysis the marking and
colouring only undergo change with respect to the
eye-spots. The concavities of the crescent-shaped
portions of the subdorsal line become <span class="locked">black,<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></span> the
remainder of this line at the same time losing
much of its whiteness, and thus becoming less
distinct, whilst the crescents assume the appearance
of small eye-spots (Fig. 20). During this
stage the curved, crescent-formed portions become
prepared for complete separation from the
remainder of the subdorsal line; and just before
the third moult the eye-spots become sharply
defined both in front and behind, whilst the black
ground-colour curves upwards, and the white spots
gradually become lenticular and commence to
enlarge (<a href="#Plate_IV">Fig. 21</a>).</p>

<p class="h7"><i>Fourth Stage.</i></p>

<p>The third moult takes place after another
interval of 5&ndash;6 days, the eye-spots then becoming
very prominent. The white nucleus of the front
spot is kidney-shaped, and that of the hind spot
egg-shaped; whilst the black ground-colour extends
as a slender border upwards along the sides of the
spots, but does not completely surround them till
towards the end of the present stage (<a href="#Plate_IV">Fig. 21</a>). The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
central portion of the white spots at the same time
becomes of a peculiar violet-brown colour inclining
to yellow above, the peripheral region alone
remaining pure white.</p>

<p>Of the subdorsal line only traces are now to be
recognized, and these are retained, with almost
unchanged intensity, sometimes into the last stage,
remaining with the greatest persistence on the
three front and on the penultimate segments,
whilst on those containing the eye-spots, <i>i.e.</i>, the
fourth and fifth, not a trace remains. At the
present stage the peculiar mingling of colours
becomes apparent over the whole of the upper
surface; the green is no longer uniform, but a
mixture of short and gently sinuous, dark green
striations on a lighter ground now appear. On
the sides of the caterpillar these stripes, which
are at first indistinct, but become more strongly
pronounced in the next stage, are arranged
obliquely on the spiracles, with the lower portions
directed forwards.</p>

<p class="h7"><i>Fifth Stage.</i></p>

<p>The fourth moult occurs 7&ndash;8 days after the
third, the caterpillar being 4&ndash;5 centimeters in
length. Whilst all the specimens hitherto observed
were with one exception light green, they now
mostly changed their colour and became dark brown.
In one case only did the brown colour appear
in the previous (fourth) stage. The striations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
previously mentioned appear as dull and interrupted
dirty yellow streaks, the same dirty yellow
colour showing itself continuously on the sides of
the four front segments. Of the subdorsal line
only a distinct trace is now to be seen on the
eleventh and on the three front segments, whilst
on the third segment the formation of another
eye-spot commences to be plainly perceptible by
a local deposition of black (<a href="#Plate_IV">Fig. 23</a>). This third
spot does not, however, become completely
developed, either in this or in the last stage, but
the subdorsal line remains continuous on the three
front segments. Among other changes at this
stage, there occurs a considerable shortening of
the caudal horn, which at the same time loses its
beautiful black and red colours and becomes
brownish.</p>

<p>The two large eye-spots have now nearly
attained complete development. The kidney-shaped
white spot has become entirely surrounded
by black; and on the brown, red, and yellow tints
present in this spot during the last stage, a nearly
black spot has been developed&mdash;the pupil of the
eye (<a href="#Plate_IV">Fig. 33</a>). In order to establish a definite
terminology for the different portions of the eye-spot,
I shall designate the pupil as the “nucleus,”
the light ground on which the pupil stands as the
“mirror,” and the black ground which surrounds
the mirror as the “ground-area.”</p>

<p>In this fifth stage the larva attains a length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
of six centimeters, after which the fifth moult
takes place, the caterpillar becoming ready for
pupation in the sixth stage. No striking changes
of colouring or marking occur after the present
stage, but only certain unimportant alterations,
which are, however, of the greatest theoretical
interest.</p>

<p class="h7"><i>Sixth Stage.</i></p>

<p>In this stage the eye-like appearance of the
spots on the front segments becomes still more
distinct than in the fifth stage; at the same time
these spots repeat themselves on all the other
segments from the fifth to the eleventh, although
certainly without pupils, and appearing only as
diffused, deep black spots, of the morphological
significance of which, however, there cannot be
the least doubt. They are situated in precisely
the same positions on the 5&ndash;11 segments as
those on the third and fourth&mdash;near the front, and
above and below the subdorsal line. A feeble
indication of the latter can often be recognized
(<a href="#Plate_IV">Fig. 23</a>).</p>

<p>In all dark brown specimens the repeated
spots can only be detected in a favourable light,
and after acquiring an intimate knowledge of the
caterpillar; but in light brown and green specimens
they appear very sharply defined.</p>

<p>There is one other new character which I have
never observed at an earlier period than the sixth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
stage, viz. the small dots which appear in pairs
near the posterior edge of segments 5&ndash;11.
These dots cannot have been developed from
the subdorsal line, as they are situated higher
than the latter. Their colour varies according to
the ground-colour of the caterpillar, but it is always
lighter, being light green in green specimens,
dull yellow in those that are light brown, and
grey in the blackish-brown caterpillars. These
“dorsal spots,” as I shall term them, are chiefly
of interest because they are present in <i>Chærocampa
Porcellus</i>, in which species they appear one
stage earlier than in <i>C. Elpenor</i>.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Chærocampa Porcellus</span>, <span class="smcap">Linn.</span></h6>

<p>Females captured on the wing, laid in the breeding-cage
single eggs of a light green colour,
spheroidal in form, and very similar to those of
<i>C. Elpenor</i>.</p>

<p class="h7"><i>First Stage.</i></p>

<p>The caterpillars on first hatching measure 3.5
millimeters in length, and are of a uniform light
green colour, with a fine white transverse line on
the posterior edge of each segment, precisely
similar to that which appears in the second stage
of <i>C. Elpenor</i>. They resemble the latter species
still further in showing a fine white subdorsal
line, which can easily be recognized by the naked
eye (<a href="#Plate_IV">Fig. 24</a>). Although the adult larva is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
distinguished from all the other known species of
<i>Chærocampa</i> by the absence of a caudal horn, a
distinct but very small one is nevertheless present
at this first stage, and is indeed retained throughout
the entire course of development, but does not
increase further in size, and thus gradually becomes
so small in proportion to the size of the caterpillar
that it may be entirely overlooked.</p>

<p>The first moult takes place after 4&ndash;5 days.</p>

<p class="h7"><i>Second Stage.</i></p>

<p>The blue-green coloration remains unchanged;
but a somewhat darker green dorsal line becomes
apparent down the middle of the back (the dorsal
vessel?), and the subdorsal line now becomes very
broad and pure white, being much more conspicuous
than in any stage of <i>C. Elpenor</i> (<a href="#Plate_IV">Fig. 25</a>).
The tapering of the three front segments occurs
at this stage, and oblique, dark green striations on
a lighter ground stand out distinctly on the spiracles.
As with <i>C. Elpenor</i>, the first traces of the
future eye-spots appear during the second stage;
not in the present case as a curvature of the
subdorsal line, but as a spot-like widening of the
latter, of a brighter white than the somewhat
greenish colour of the remainder of the line.</p>

<p class="h7"><i>Third Stage.</i></p>

<p>After the second moult, the formation of the
dark “ground-area” of the eye-spots commences by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
the appearance of a little brown on the under edge
of the foremost of the white spots, this coloration
gradually increasing in extent and in depth. At
the same time both spots become more sharply
distinguishable from the subdorsal line, which
becomes constantly greener (<a href="#Plate_IV">Fig. 27</a>). The brown
colour soon grows round the white of the front
eye-spot, which becomes so far perfected; whilst
the completion of the hind spot is effected slowly
afterwards. The formation of the eye-spots does
not therefore proceed any more rapidly in this
species than in <i>C. Elpenor</i>.</p>

<p>At the end of the present stage the length of
the caterpillar is about four centimeters; the ground
colour is still sea-green; the subdorsal line is much
diminished, completely fading away at its lower
edge, but remaining sharply defined above, against
the green ground-colour (<a href="#Plate_IV">Fig. 26</a>).</p>

<p class="h7"><i>Fourth Stage.</i></p>

<p>After the third moult all the caterpillars (5)
became brown, this change occurring therefore one
stage earlier than is generally the case with <i>C.
Elpenor</i>. In single instances the brown colour
appeared in the third stage. The subdorsal line
had disappeared from all the segments but the three
first and the last. The eye-spots now rapidly
attained complete development; they contained a
black pupil, and gave the insect a truly repulsive
appearance when, on being threatened by danger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
it drew in the front segments, and expanded the
fourth (<a href="#Plate_IV">Fig. 28</a>). The eye-spots of the fifth segment
are much less developed than in <i>C. Elpenor</i>;
they remain small, and are not readily detected.
On the other hand, there now appear on all the
segments with the exception of the last, just as in
the sixth stage of <i>C. Elpenor</i>, distinct rudiments of
eye-spots, which present the appearance of irregular,
roundish, black spots on the front borders of the
segments, at the height of the former subdorsal
line. In this latter region the black pigment is
disposed as a longitudinal streak, and to this a
median line is added, the whole forming a marking
which perhaps makes the caterpillar appear
still more alarming to its foes. This marking is,
however, only to be distinctly recognized on the
three first segments. The “dorsal spots” mentioned
in the case of <i>C. Elpenor</i> then appear very
distinctly on segments 5&ndash;11.</p>

<p>The caterpillars continued to feed for eleven
days after the third moult, at the end of which
period the fourth moult took place, but without
the occurrence of any change of marking. The
larvæ then buried themselves, the complete
development having taken 28&ndash;29 days.</p>

<p>The development of the <i>Porcellus</i> caterpillar
was twice followed; in 1869 in twelve, and in
1874 in five specimens. In no case did I obtain
caterpillars which remained green throughout the
entire course of development, although this colour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
is stated in the books to occur occasionally in these
larvæ; neither have I been able to find any figure
of an adult green specimen, so that it must in the
meantime be admitted that such specimens, if they
occur at all, are exceptional <span class="locked">instances.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></span> The
theoretical bearing of this admission will appear
later on.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Results of the development of Chærocampa Elpenor
and C. Porcellus; comparison of these with the
other known species of Chærocampa.</span></h6>

<p>The first stage of <i>Elpenor</i> shows that the most
remote ancestor of the genus possessed no kind of
marking, but was uniformly green. At a later
period, the white longitudinal stripe which I have
designated the “subdorsal line” made its appearance,
and at a still later period this line vanished,
with the exception of a few more or less distinct
remnants, whilst, at the same time, from certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
portions of it, the eye-spots of the fourth and fifth
segments became developed. After the perfecting
of the eye-spots, weak repetitions of the
latter appeared as black spots on all the segments
except the last.</p>

<p>In <i>Porcellus</i> the caterpillar emerges from the
egg with the subdorsal line, the first stage of
<i>Elpenor</i> being omitted. From this fact we may
venture to conclude that <i>Porcellus</i> is the younger
species, or, what comes to the same thing, that
it has further advanced in development. The
whole subsequent history of <i>Porcellus</i> agrees with
this view, its course of development being essentially
but a repetition of the phenomena displayed
by <i>Elpenor</i>, and differing only in one point, viz.
that all new characters make their appearance
one stage earlier than in the latter species. This
is the case with the transformation of the green
into a brown ground-colour; with the repetition of
the eye-spots on the remaining segments in the
form of suffused black spots; and with the appearance
of the light “dorsal spots.” Only the eye-spots
themselves appear, and the snout-like tapering
of the front segments occurs in the same stage
as in <i>Elpenor</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the second.</p>

<p>From these data alone, we may venture to infer
the occurrence of four chief stages in the phyletic
development of the genus. The first stage was
simply green, without any marking; the second
showed a subdorsal line; the third, eye-spots on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
the third and fourth segments; and the fourth
stage showed a repetition of the eye-spots, although
but rudimentary, on all the remaining segments
with the exception of the twelfth.</p>

<p>Now if we compare the other known species
of <i>Chærocampa</i> larvæ with the above, we shall
arrive at the interesting conclusion that all these
species can be arranged in three groups, which
correspond exactly with the three last phyletic
stages as just deduced from the ontogeny of <i>C.
Elpenor</i> and <i>Porcellus</i>.</p>

<p>Of the genus <i>Chærocampa</i>,<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> over fifty species
have been <span class="locked">described,<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></span> of which the larvæ of only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
fifteen are known in the form which they possess
at the last ontogenetic stage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Group</span> 1.&mdash;I can furnish but little information
with respect to this group. The first species with
which I became acquainted was <i>Chærocampa
Syriaca</i>,<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> of which I saw two blown caterpillars in
Staudinger’s collection, and which I have figured in
<a href="#Plate_IV">Pl. IV</a>., Fig. 29. The larva is green, and has the
short oblique stripes over the legs common to so
many species of <i>Chærocampa</i>, the only marking
besides these being a simple white subdorsal line,
without any trace of eye-spots. This species exactly
corresponds therefore with the second ontogenetic
stage of <i>C. Elpenor</i> and <i>Porcellus</i>. The account of
the species, both in the larval and perfect state, is
unfortunately so imperfect, that we cannot with
certainty infer the age of the two caterpillars from
their size. If the moth were of the same size as
<i>Elpenor</i>, then the caterpillar figured, having a
length of 5.3 centimeters, would not be in the last
but in the penultimate stage, and it remains doubtful
whether it may not acquire eye-spots in the last
stage.</p>

<p>That species exist, however, which in their last
stage correspond to the second stage of <i>Elpenor</i>,
is shown by two of the forms belonging to
Walker’s genus <i>Darapsa</i>, which was founded on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
the characters of the imagines only. Ten species
of this genus are given in Gray’s catalogue, the
adult larva of two of these being known through
the excellent figures of Abbot and <span class="locked">Smith.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></span> These
two caterpillars possess the characteristic tapering
form in a very marked degree; one is figured in
the attitude so often assumed by our species of
<i>Chærocampa</i> on the approach of danger, the three
front segments being withdrawn into the fourth.
(Fig. 34, <a href="#Plate_IV">Pl. IV</a>., is copied from this Plate).
There are no eye-spots either in <i>D. Myron</i> or <i>D.
Chœrilus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> but only a broad white subdorsal line;
underneath which, and to a certain extent proceeding
from it, there are oblique white stripes,
precisely similar to those which meet the subdorsal
line in the third stage of <i>C. Porcellus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Group</span> 2.&mdash;This group contains numerous
species which, like our native <i>C. Elpenor</i> and
<i>Porcellus</i>, show eye-spots on the fourth and fifth
segments, whilst these markings are absent, or at
most only present in traces, on the remainder. To
this section there belong, besides the two species
mentioned, five others, viz. in Europe, <i>C. Celerio</i>
and <i>Alecto</i> (not certainly known?);<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> in India,
<i>C. Nessus</i>, Drury, and <i>Lucasii</i>, <span class="locked">Boisduval;<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></span> and
an unnamed species from Port Natal.</p>

<p>In the species belonging to this group the subdorsal
line may be more or less retained. Thus,
<i>C. Celerio</i>, according to Hübner’s figure, has a
broad yellow line extending from the horn to the
sixth segment, whilst it is completely absent on
the three front segments. In the unnamed species
from Port <span class="locked">Natal<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></span> the subdorsal line extends to
the front edge of the fifth segment, and on the
fourth segment only is there a perfect eye-spot,
whilst on the succeeding segments traces of such
markings can be recognized as dark spots similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
to those in <i>Elpenor</i> and <i>Porcellus</i>. The transition
to the third group is through another unnamed
species from <span class="locked">Mozambique,<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></span> in which
rather large eye-spots have become developed
on the fourth and fifth segments and these
are followed by a subdorsal line, which only
appears distinctly at certain places. On this
broken subdorsal line, and not completely separated
from it, there are small, roundish eye-spots,
situated near the front edge of each segment;
these being, therefore, a somewhat more
perfect repetition of the front <span class="locked">eye-spots.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Group</span> 3.&mdash;In the species of this group the
eye-spots are repeated on all the segments. I
am acquainted with seven such <i>Chærocampa</i> larvæ,
of which <i>C. Bisecta</i>, <span class="locked">Horsfield,<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></span> shows some
affinity to the foregoing group, since the eye-spots
on segments 6&ndash;11 have not yet attained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
full perfection. In <i>C. Odenlandiæ</i>, <span class="locked">Fabr.,<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></span> and in
<i>C. Alecto</i> from <span class="locked">India,<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></span> the eye-spots appear to be
perfectly alike on all the segments; whilst in
<i>C. Acteus</i>, <span class="locked">Cram.,<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></span> and in the North American
<i>C. Tersa</i><a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> (<a href="#Plate_IV">Pl. IV</a>., Fig. 35) they are smaller on
the other segments than on the fourth; and in
<i>C. Celerio</i>, Linn., from <span class="locked">India,<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></span> the size of the
spots diminishes from the head to the tail.</p>

<p>In this group also the subdorsal line is retained
in a very variable degree. In some species it
appears to have completely vanished (<i>C. Acteus</i>,
<i>Celerio</i>); in others it is present as a light stripe
extending along all the segments (<i>C. Alecto</i>);
whilst in others it is retained as a broad white
stripe, which extends only to the fourth segment
(<i>C. Tersa</i>, <a href="#Plate_IV">Fig. 35</a>). In species possessing eye-spots,
the subdorsal line is thus a very variable
character. It is, however, an interesting fact that
even in the present group, which has made the
greatest step forward, the subdorsal line is of
general occurrence, because the eye-spots in all
these species may have almost a similar development
to those of <i>Elpenor</i> and <i>Porcellus</i>. The
ontogeny of the tropical species would alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
give a definite reply on this point, but unfortunately
we are not acquainted with any of
the young forms, so that we can but presume
that some of them at least would show only in the
first stage the simple subdorsal line without eye-spots;
that in the second stage the primary pairs
of eye-spots would be formed on the fourth and
fifth segments, whilst the transference of these
spots to the remaining segments would take place
in the last stage.</p>

<p>The foregoing assumption is based immediately
on the ontogeny of <i>Elpenor</i> and <i>Porcellus</i>; it is
supported by the considerable size attained by the
eye-spots in many species of the third group,
and would receive additional confirmation by
observations on the Indian <i>C. Celerio</i>, supposing
that Horsfield’s statements do not arise from a
confusion of species. This skilful observer, who
was the first to breed systematically a large
number of tropical larvæ, has given a figure of the
Indian caterpillar of <i>C. Celerio</i>, according to which
this species possesses eye-spots on all the segments
from the fourth to the tenth. The European
form of this same species has eye-spots only on
segments four and five, a fact which does not
appear to have been known to Horsfield, as no
mention of it is made in his notice of the Indian
species. If the caterpillar figured is really that
of <i>Celerio</i>, which I consider to be by no means
improbable, not only is it thus shown that in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
species of the third group the ocelli on the hind
segments have a secondary origin through a
repetition of the primary ones of the front
segments, but we can also establish that the same
species in two different regions may arrive at two
different phyletic stages.</p>

<p>If, finally, we sum up the facts taught by the
ontogeny of the two German species, and the
adult forms of the other species, we can form
therefrom a tolerably complete picture of the
course of development of the genus <i>Chærocampa</i>.
Of the four phyletic stages indicated by the
ontogeny of <i>Elpenor</i> and <i>Porcellus</i>, three still
form the terminus of the development of existing
species. The great differences among the
caterpillars of this genus can be very simply explained
on the view that they stand at different
levels of phyletic development; some species
having remained far behind (Group 1), others
having advanced further (Group 2), and others
having reached the highest point of development
(Group 3). The fact that the species of the third
group are only tropical accords well with this view,
since many facts prove that phyletic development
proceeds more rapidly in the tropics than in
temperate climates.</p>

<p>The striking markings of the <i>Chærocampa</i>
larvæ may, in brief, be stated to originate from a
local transformation of two portions of the subdorsal
line into eye-spots, and the subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
transference of these two primary ocelli to the other
segments. The eye-spots always originate on
segments four and five, and from these the transference
mostly occurs backwards, although in
certain cases it takes place at the same time
forwards. Herein, <i>i.e.</i> in the origin of the eye-spots,
there lies a great distinction between the
genus <i>Chærocampa</i> and the genus <i>Deilephila</i>, with
which it was formerly associated, and in which the
origin of a very similar kind of marking can be
traced to quite another source.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Genus Deilephila, Ochsenheimer.</span></h5>

<p>I am acquainted with the caterpillars of nine
European and one North American species,
these differing in marking to such a wonderful
extent that they appear to offer at first sight but
little hope of being able to trace them to a common
form. These ten species can be separated,
according to their markings, into five groups,
which I will briefly define before entering upon
their ontogeny.</p>

<p>The first group consists of three species, and
comprises the commonest and most widely-ranging
of all the European species, <i>Deilephila Euphorbiæ</i>,
as well as <i>D. Dahlii</i> from Sardinia and Corsica,
and <i>D. Nicæa</i>, a species of very restricted range,
which appears to occur only in one small district
on the French coast of the Mediterranean. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
three species agree in marking to the extent of
their possessing in the adult form two rows of
ring-spots on each side, whilst the subdorsal line is
completely absent.</p>

<p>The second group, consisting also of three
species, shows a great resemblance to <i>Euphorbiæ</i>,
but has only one row of ring-spots. It contains
<i>D. Vespertilio</i>, <i>D. Galii</i>, and the Algerian
<i>D. Mauritanica</i>.</p>

<p>For the third group I only know one representative,
<i>D. Livornica</i>, Esp., which possesses a
single row of ring-spots connected by a subdorsal
line.</p>

<p>Another group is composed of <i>D. Zygophylli</i>,
which occurs on the shores of the Caspian Sea,
and the North American <i>D. Lineata</i>; these species
possessing a strongly marked subdorsal line, associated
with more or less distinct ring-spots, which
I shall designate as “open rings,” because their
black border does not intersect the subdorsal line,
but has the form of an arch above and below it.</p>

<p>In the last group, represented by <i>D. Hippophaës</i>,
which occurs at the foot of the Alps (Wallis), and
southward as far as Andalusia, there is only a broad
subdorsal line, generally without any trace of a
row of spots.</p>

<p>The important differences of marking displayed
by these five groups are not in any way accidental,
but they represent different stages of phyletic
development; or, in other words, the five groups<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
are of different ages, the first (<i>Euphorbiæ</i>, &amp;c.)
being the youngest, and the last (<i>Hippophaës</i>) the
oldest of the genus.</p>

<p>According to their phyletic age, the groups
follow each other in inverse order, the first being
<i>Hippophaës</i>, the second that of <i>Zygophylli</i>, the
third that of <i>Livornica</i>, the fourth that of <i>Galii</i>,
and the fifth and youngest that of <i>Euphorbiæ</i>.
Only in this last am I acquainted with the
<i>complete</i> development of one species, for which
reason I commence with this group, thus proceeding
from the youngest to the oldest forms,
instead of taking the more natural course from
the simplest and oldest to the youngest and most
complicated.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Deilephila Euphorbiæ</span>, <span class="smcap">Linn.</span></h6>

<p>Some captured females were at once placed in an
enclosure about the size of a small sitting-room.
It was evident that they did not feel quite at home
under these conditions, frequently beating their
heads and wings against the tarlatan, but some of
them nevertheless laid eggs at the base of the
leaves of <i>Euphorbia Cyparissias</i>. The eggs
much resemble those of <i>Chærocampa Elpenor</i>,
being spheroidal in form, but rather smaller, and
of a somewhat darker green. They were laid in
small clusters composed sometimes of as many as
seven, the single eggs being placed near together,
but never touching, and seldom at the point of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
leaf, but generally near the end of a twig, where
young shoots are in close proximity. During
the embryonic development the eggs become
coloured, first yellow and partly blackish, and
finally completely black.</p>

<p class="h7"><i>First Stage.</i></p>

<p>The young caterpillars (Fig. 37, <a href="#Plate_V">Pl. V</a>.)
immediately after hatching measure four millimeters
in length; they are at first rather light,
but in the course of half-an-hour they are seen
by the naked eye to become of a deep velvety
black; later, on increasing in size, they again
become paler, appearing of a greenish-black, and
subsequently blackish-green. On further increasing
in size (<a href="#Plate_V">Fig. 38</a>), they are blackish-green,
with the horn, head, legs, and a crescent-shaped
chitinous plate on the back of the prothorax
black. There are also on the last segment a
double and two single black chitinous plates. Of
the later marking of the caterpillar there is
scarcely anything present. The spiracles appear
as white spots, and on each segment there are a
number (mostly ten) of small warts, each of which
emits a single bristle.</p>

<p>When the young larvæ have attained a length
of seven millimeters they are olive-green, and do
not contrast so brilliantly with the green of the
<i>Euphorbia</i> leaves as before; neither do they as yet
possess any markings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span></p>

<p class="h7"><i>Second Stage.</i></p>

<p>The first ecdysis occurs after five days, and
with this there appears quite suddenly a very
complicated pattern. The ground-colour is now
a light yellowish-green (<a href="#Plate_V">Fig. 39</a>), and on each
of the twelve segments, near the front border, there
is a pure white round spot in the middle of a large
black transverse spot. I shall designate these, in
accordance with the nomenclature employed for
<i>Chærocampa</i>, as the white “mirrors” on black
“ground-areas,” both together constituting “ring-spots,”
as distinguished from “eye-spots” proper,
in which a “nucleus,” the pupil of the eye, is also
added. In many, but not in all specimens, very
distinct traces of a subdorsal line can be seen as
a light whitish stripe connecting the white spots.
The horn, the thoracic and prolegs, and some
spots on the head, are black.</p>

<p>The caterpillars remain unaltered till after four
days, when, having a length of 17 millimeters, the
second moult takes place, bringing with it changes
quite as great as those which occurred with the
first.</p>

<p class="h7"><i>Third Stage.</i></p>

<p>The caterpillar now assumes the shagreened
appearance which it possesses in the adult state.
Small white warts are arranged in rows from the
dorsal to the spiracular line, and again underneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
this line on the abdominal legs. These dots are
not only of value as a character for differentiating
the genera <i>Deilephila</i> and <i>Chærocampa</i>, but they
also play a part in the peculiar spot-marking which
will be shown later on. The ground-colour of the
caterpillar is now light green (<a href="#Plate_V">Fig. 40</a>), replaced
by black on certain parts. From the black
“ground-area” of the ring-spots, two black
triangles extend towards the posterior borders
of the segments, but usually without reaching
them.</p>

<p>The ring-spots are not essentially changed, although
it may be observed that in most specimens
the shagreen-dots under each ring-spot are somewhat
larger, and stand closer together than in
other places. In the following stage they become
fused into a second white “mirror,” so that two
ring-spots stand one above the other, their black
ground-areas meeting. The formation of the
second ring-spot sometimes takes place in the
present stage (<a href="#Plate_V">Fig. 42</a>).</p>

<p>The subdorsal line has now completely vanished,
whilst the spiracular <span class="locked">line<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></span> appears as a broad stripe
above the legs. The horn is yellow with a black
point, and the black spots on the head have increased
in size.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span></p>

<p class="h7"><i>Fourth Stage.</i></p>

<p>The third moult, which again occurs after four
days, is not accompanied by such important
changes. The green ground-colour has now
completely disappeared, and is replaced by a dull
black. The caterpillars are now, as also in the
previous stage, extremely variable. Thus, for
example, a triangular patch of the green ground-colour
may be retained on the posterior edge of
the segments (<a href="#Plate_V">Fig. 41</a>), those specimens which
possess this character generally having their markings
retarded in development, as shown by the
absence of the second “mirror” of the ring-spots.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Plate_V">Fig. 41</a> the shagreen-dots from which
this second “mirror” is subsequently formed,
are distinctly larger than the others, and on the
eleventh segment two of them have already
coalesced.</p>

<p class="h7"><i>Fifth Stage.</i></p>

<p>After another period of four days, the fourth
moult takes place. The marking remains the same,
but the colours become more vivid; the brick-red of
the head, horn, dorsal line and legs, changing into
a fiery red. The spiracular line, formerly green
alternating with yellow, generally becomes resolved
into a row of reddish-yellow spots. Ten
days later the caterpillar (8.5 centimeters in
length), ceases to feed, and prepares for pupation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
In this last stage also there is great variability
of colour, but although each particular character
is subject to fluctuation, the individuals of the same
brood show but little variation among <span class="locked">themselves.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></span>
Thus, the dorsal line is sometimes black, and
sometimes red, or again, this colour interrupted
with black, so that only small red spots mark its
course. The head may be entirely red, or this
colour mixed with black. On the under side of
the caterpillar, red generally predominates, but in
some specimens this is replaced by black. The
ground-colour is also variable, being generally
a shining brownish-black, but sometimes dull
coaly black. The shagreen-dots are sometimes
white and sometimes yellow, and the “mirrors” of
the ring-spots are also often yellowish.</p>

<p>The most interesting variation, however, appears
to me to be the following:&mdash;In many specimens
from Kaiserstuhl (Breisgau), the red was unusually
vivid, and was not limited to the ordinary places,
but occupied also the triangles on the posterior
edges of the segments (<a href="#Plate_V">Fig. 44</a>), which are green
in the third and fourth stages (<a href="#Plate_V">Fig. 42</a>). This
variety has also been figured by Hübner. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
one individual (<a href="#Plate_V">Fig. 43</a>), the under ring-spots
were wanting, whilst the upper ones possessed a
beautiful red nucleus fading away anteriorly, and
showing the first step in the formation of a complete
eye-spot.</p>

<p>I cannot positively assert that a fifth moult occurs
in the last ten days, although I am very doubtful
whether this is the case. It is certain, however,
that some time before pupation, and whilst the
larva is still feeding, the striking colours fade out,
and become replaced chiefly by black.</p>

<p>The ontogeny of this species is obviously but
a very incomplete representation of its phyletic
development. This is at once apparent from the
large gap between the first and second stages. It
is not possible that a row of ring-spots can have
arisen suddenly; in all probability they have been
developed from a subdorsal line, which in <i>Euphorbiæ</i>
is now only indicated in the second stage by
a faint line. This conjecture is raised to a certainty
when we call in the aid of the remaining
species of <i>Deilephila</i>.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Deilephila Nicæa, De Prunner.</span></h6>

<p>I only know this species from blown larvæ in
Staudinger’s collection, and Duponchel’s figure, of
which Fig. 51, <a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI</a>. is a copy. The adult insect
possesses two perfectly separated rows of ring-spots.
Duponchel figures also two younger stages,
of which the youngest is probably the third stage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
The larva is 18 millimeters in length, of a leaf-green
colour, and shows no trace of a subdorsal
line, but possesses the two rows of ring-spots,
which only differ from those of the succeeding
stages in the green colour of the “mirror.”</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Deilephila Dahlii, Treitschke.</span></h6>

<p>I am familiar with numerous specimens in various
stages, collected in Sardinia by Dr. Staudinger,
and preserved by inflation.</p>

<p>The first stage is blackish, and shows no kind of
marking; thus agreeing with the corresponding
stage of <i>Euphorbiæ</i>. The second stage is unfortunately
not represented in Staudinger’s collection.</p>

<p>The third stage shows a row of ring-spots, which
are, however, connected by a very distinct and
sharply defined subdorsal line. In the fourth
stage a second row of (under) ring-spots is added,
whilst the subdorsal line generally at the same
time disappears.</p>

<p>The caterpillar remains unchanged during the
fifth stage, when it shows a great resemblance in
marking to <i>Euphorbiæ</i>; neither does it appear to
differ essentially from this species in colour, so far
as can be judged from preserved specimens and
single figures (in Duponchel and Hübner). I
have, moreover, seen several larvæ in the last
stage, and the subdorsal could be distinctly recognized
as a broad light stripe.</p>

<p>Of the four groups, the second (that of <i>Galii</i>),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
appears to me to be of but very little importance,
as I shall now proceed to show from the development
of <i>D. Vespertilio</i>.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Deilephila Vespertilio, Fabricius.</span></h6>

<p>Hitherto I have unfortunately been unable to
obtain fertile eggs of this species, so that I can
say nothing about the first stage. The latter
would have been of interest, not only because of
the marking, but also because of the presence of a
residual caudal horn.</p>

<p>I am likewise only acquainted with the end of
the second stage, having found, at the end of June
1873, a single caterpillar on <i>Epilobium Rosmarinifolium</i>,
just previous to its second ecdysis. In the
case of such young caterpillars, however, the new
characters which appear in the succeeding stage
are generally perceptible through the transparent
chitinous skin at the end of the preceding stage,
so that the markings of the insect are thus caused
to change. The caterpillar found was about 16
millimeters long, and of a beautiful smooth and
shining grass-green (<a href="#Plate_III">Fig. 13</a>). A broad white
subdorsal line extended from the first to the penultimate
segment, from which the horn was completely
absent. On close inspection the first traces
of the ring-spots could be detected near the anterior
edge of each segment as feeble, round, yellow,
ill-defined spots, situated on the subdorsal line itself
(<a href="#Plate_III">Fig. 13</a>). On the first segment only there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
no spot, and here no ring-spot is afterwards
formed. Besides these markings, there was only
to be seen a yellowish-white spiracular line.</p>

<p>This solitary specimen unfortunately buried itself
before the moult for which it had prepared itself
had occurred; but this ecdysis is associated with
a very important transformation. This statement
is founded on a blown specimen in Staudinger’s
collection; it is only 18 millimeters in length,
but already shows the later grey colouring in
place of the beautiful green. In this, the third
stage, the broad white subdorsal line bears on
each segment a red spot enclosed between black
crescents above and below (<a href="#Plate_VI">Fig. 49 A</a>). In the
fourth stage, during which I have seen many
living caterpillars, the subdorsal line is still distinctly
present in some individuals (<a href="#Plate_III">Fig. 14</a>), but
the spots (“mirrors”) are now completely surrounded
by a narrow black ring (“ground-area”),
which sharply separates them from the subdorsal
line (<a href="#Plate_VI">Fig. 49 B</a>). In the fifth stage this
ring becomes a somewhat irregularly formed black
“ground-area,” whilst the subdorsal line completely
vanishes (<a href="#Plate_VI">Figs. 51 and 49 C</a>). The mirrors
are white, but generally have a reddish nucleus,
which obviously corresponds to the primary yellow
spots from which the whole development of the
ring-spots originates. This character is, however,
sometimes absent; and many other variations also
occur in the earlier stages, all of which can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
easily explained as cases of arrested, or retarded
development. Thus, the subdorsal line often disappears
earlier, and is only present in the fourth
stage as a feeble light stripe.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Deilephila Galii, Fabricius.</span></h6>

<p>The markings of this species appear to be
developed in a precisely similar manner to those
of <i>D. Vespertilio</i>. The adult larva, as in the last
species, shows no trace of a subdorsal line. A row
of large black spots, each having an irregular
round, yellowish-white nucleus, is situated on an
olive-green, blackish-brown, brown, or dirty yellow
ground. I have, unfortunately, also in this case
been unable to procure fertile eggs. There is,
however, one figure of a caterpillar, 2.5 centimeters
long, by Hübner, which is of a light green colour,
and has five longitudinal lines; one dorsal, two
subdorsal, and a spiracular line. The subdorsal
is white, and bears in the place of the ring-spots
small red dots, whilst the line itself is bordered
with black where the red spots are situated.
Hübner has probably figured the third stage, so
that we may venture to conclude that in the second
stage there is a subdorsal line either quite free
from spots, or only showing such feeble rudiments
as are to be seen in the second stage of
<i>Vespertilio</i>.</p>

<p>I found two specimens in the fourth stage in
the Upper Engadine. One of these (<a href="#Plate_V">Fig. 45</a>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
was already of a dark, blackish-green <span class="locked">ground-colour<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></span>
with a broad, greenish-white subdorsal
line sharply defined throughout its entire length,
and containing ring-spots of a sulphur-yellow with
an orange-red nucleus; the black “ground-area”
did not encroach upon the subdorsal line, but was
confined to two faint crescents situated above
and below the “mirror.” Only the two foremost
“mirrors” (on the second and third segments)
were without nuclei.</p>

<p>The remaining peculiarities of coloration are
shown in the figure. I may here only point out
the shagreening present on the sides and a
portion of the under surface.</p>

<p>The specimen figured was 3.3 centimeters long;
a second example measured 2.8 centimeters in
length, and was essentially similar, but showed
that a considerable amount of variability must
prevail at this stage of development. It was pitchy
black, with a very indistinct subdorsal line and a
few ring-spots, the “mirrors” of which were
also sulphur-yellow, with the orange-red nucleus.
The shagreening was quite as strong as in the
first specimen, the dots being yellow instead of white.
It is specially to be observed, because of its important
theoretical bearing, that in this larva the
ring-spots were absent on the three front segments,
and on the fourth only, a faint indication of one
could be perceived. In the caterpillar figured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
the ring-spots increase also in distinctness from
the tail to the head.</p>

<p class="h7"><i>Fifth Stage.</i></p>

<p>The two specimens just mentioned, after moulting,
acquired the well-known markings of the adult
caterpillar already briefly described above. The
fifth is the last stage.</p>

<p>The larva is known to occur in several variations,
Rösel having figured it in three forms; light green,
olive-green, and dirty yellow. It has not been
since considered worth the trouble to attend to
the subject of caterpillar coloration. Thus, <span class="locked">Wilde,<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></span>
in his well-known work, takes no notice of Rösel’s
observation, but simply describes the caterpillar
of <i>Galii</i> as “blackish olive-green.”</p>

<p>Having had an opportunity of observing twenty-five
adult specimens of this somewhat scarce
species at one time, I am able to state that it is
not in this instance di- or polymorphism, but a
case presenting a great degree of variability, with
which we have to deal. There are not several
sharply-defined types of coloration; but the
extremes are connected by numerous intermediate
forms. The extreme forms, however, certainly
preponderate.</p>

<p>I have never met with Rösel’s light green form;
neither was there a dark green specimen among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
the twenty-five mentioned, and I only know this
variety from single individuals, found at a former
period. Among the twenty-five caterpillars; all
gradations of colour occurred, from pitchy black to
light clay-yellow, and even to an almost whitish-yellow;
some were brownish-black, others of a
beautiful chestnut-brown, and others yellowish
brown, dark clay-yellow, or brownish-red. Out
of twenty-one specimens of which the ground-colours
were noted, there were nine black, nine
clay-yellow, and three brown; each of the three
groups again showing various minor modifications
of colour. The other colours also varied somewhat.
Thus, the “mirrors” were sometimes
white, sometimes strong yellow, and occasionally
they also contained a reddish nucleus.</p>

<p>The variations in the shagreening were especially
interesting, inasmuch as these appeared
to have a striking connection with the general
colouring of the caterpillar. Black specimens
seldom show such sparse shagreening as that
represented in <a href="#Plate_V">Pl. V</a>., Fig. 46, but are generally
thickly scattered with large shagreen-dots right up
to the dorsal line (Fig. 47, <a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI</a>.), then strikingly
resembling the adult larva of <i>D. Euphorbiæ</i>. The
light ochreous-yellow individuals, on the other
hand, were sometimes entirely without shagreening
(Fig. 48, <a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI</a>.), being smooth, and much
resembling the light ochreous-yellow or yellowish-red
caterpillar of <i>D. Nicæa</i> (Fig. 51, <a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI</a>.).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
I have never seen a caterpillar of <i>Galii</i> which
showed traces of the subdorsal line in the last
stage, nor have I ever met with one which
possessed a second row of “mirror” spots; so that
retrogression or a sudden advance in development
does not appear to occur.</p>

<p>Of the North African <i>D. Mauritanica</i>, which
likewise belongs to the <i>Galii</i> group, I have not
been able to obtain specimens or figures of the
younger stages. The adult caterpillar is very
similar to that of <i>Euphorbiæ</i>, but differs in the
absence of the second row of ring-spots. For
this reason it must be regarded as a retarded
form at an older stage of phyletic development.</p>

<p>I now proceed to the <i>Livornica</i> group.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Deilephila Livornica, Esper.</span></h6>

<p>This, the only European species here to be
considered, possesses almost the same markings
as <i>Galii</i> in its fourth stage, <i>i.e.</i>, a subdorsal line
with interpolated ring-spots. The species is
known to be rare, and I have not been able to
obtain living specimens, but I have examined
several blown larvæ, all of which agree in having
the ring-spots sharply distinct from the whitish
subdorsal line, so that the latter is thereby
interrupted. Figures of the adult larva are
given in the works of Hübner, Boisduval, and
Duponchel. In most specimens the ground-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>colour
is brown, although <span class="locked">Boisduval<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></span> also figures a
light green specimen; from which it may be inferred,
from analogy with <i>Galii</i> and <i>Vespertilio</i>, that the
first stages are green. In Dr. Staudinger’s collection
there is a young larva, probably in the
fourth stage, the ground-colour of which is light
ash-grey. The dorsal and subdorsal lines are
white, the latter showing in the positions where
the ring-spots subsequently appear, small white
“mirrors” with red nuclei, exactly corresponding
to the stage of <i>Vespertilio</i> represented in
Fig. 49 A, <a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI</a>. The “mirrors” are nothing
more than dilatations of the subdorsal line, which
is not therefore interrupted by them. The black
“ground-area” does not surround the “mirrors”
completely, but borders them only above and
below, and is much more strongly developed
above, extending in this direction to the dorsal
line.</p>

<p>The fourth group comprises the two species
<i>D. Lineata</i>, Fabr., and <i>D. Zygophylli</i>, Ochs., the
former being the North American representative
of our <i>D. Livornica</i>, but differing in remaining
permanently at the fourth stage of this last species.
I am acquainted with <i>D. Lineata</i> only through
the figure of the adult larva given by Abbot and
Smith, which figure, judging from the position and
form of the spots, I am compelled to believe is
not quite correct, notwithstanding the excellence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
of the other illustrations. The ground-colour of
the caterpillar is green; the subdorsal yellow,
bordered with black, slightly curved, arched lines,
which nowhere interrupt its continuity. This
North American species appears therefore to be
an older form than our <i>Livornica</i>.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Deilephila Zygophylli, Ochsenheimer.</span></h6>

<p>This species, which is the next allied form to
<i>D. Lineata</i>, is an inhabitant of Southern Russia.
I have seen four specimens of the caterpillar in
Dr. Staudinger’s collection, three of which are
certainly in the last ontogenetic stage. The
ground-colour appears ash-grey, ash-brown, or
blackish with whitish granulations. A broad
white subdorsal line extends to the base of the
black caudal horn, this line in one specimen
appearing at first sight not to possess a trace of
spot rudiments (<a href="#Plate_VI">Fig. 50</a>). On closer investigation,
however, there could be observed, in the
same position where the ring-spots stand in the
other species of <i>Deilephila</i>, small black crescents
above and below the subdorsal line. In other
specimens the white subdorsal line had also
become expanded in these positions into distinct
spots; indeed, in one individual light white
mirror-spots, bordered above and below by black
crescents, stood on the subdorsal line (<a href="#Plate_VI">Fig. 50 A</a>).</p>

<p>It is thus in this distinguishing character that
the caterpillar is extremely variable, and we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
suppose either that this species is now in a state
of transition to a higher stage of phyletic development,
or else that the ring-spots were formerly more
strongly developed, and are now degenerating.
The developmental history of the larva could alone
decide which of these two views is correct. There
would be no difficulty in procuring materials for
this purpose if one of the numerous and zealous
Russian naturalists would take up the subject.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Deilephila Hippophaës, Esper.</span></h6>

<p>This is the only representative of the fifth and
oldest group known to me. The moth resembles
<i>D. Euphorbiæ</i> to the extent of being sometimes
confounded with it, a circumstance which is made
the more remarkable by the fact that the caterpillars
are so completely different.</p>

<p>The adult larva of this local moth has been
made known by the figures, more or less exact, in
the works of Hübner, Boisduval, and Duponchel.
Wilde also gives a description of it, although from
a foreign source. I will not here delay myself by
criticizing the different descriptions and figures;
they are partly correct, partly inexact, and sometimes
altogether erroneous; they were of no avail
for the question which here primarily concerns us,
and new observation had to be undertaken.</p>

<p>I have been able to compare altogether about
forty caterpillars, thirty-five of which were living.
All these specimens possessed nearly the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
greyish-green ground-colour, and most of them had
exactly the simple marking as represented, for
instance, in Hübner’s figure, <i>i.e.</i>, a rather broad
greenish-white subdorsal line, somewhat faded at
the edges, and without a trace of spots on any of
the segments with the exception of the eleventh,
on which there was a yellowish, black-bordered
mirror-spot, with a broad, diffused, vivid orange-red
nucleus. Specimens also occur, and by no
means uncommonly, in which no other markings
are to be seen than those mentioned; there were
nine among twenty-eight examples compared from
this point of view.</p>

<p>In many other individuals of this species small
red spots appear on the subdorsal line, exactly in
the positions where the ring-spots are situated in
the other species of the genus (<a href="#Plate_VII">Fig. 60</a>), so that
these spots are thus repetitions of the single ring-spot&mdash;a
fact which must appear of the greatest
interest in connection with the development of the
markings throughout the whole genus. But this
is not all, for again in other specimens, these red
spots stand on a large yellow “mirror,” and in one
individual (<a href="#Plate_VII">Fig. 59</a>), they had become developed
into well-formed ring-spots through the addition of
a black border. We have thus presented to us in
one and the same stage of a species, the complete
development of ring-spots from a subdorsal line.</p>

<p>These facts acquire a still greater interest, as showing
how new elements of marking are produced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
The spots on the subdorsal line decrease from the
posterior to the anterior segments, so that they
must undoubtedly be regarded as a repetition or
transference of the ring-spot previously developed
on the eleventh segment. I will now proceed to
furnish proofs in support of this statement.</p>

<p>I have never met with any specimens having
ring-spots on all the segments&mdash;in the most prominent
instances these spots were present on segments
10&ndash;5. This was the case in three out of
the twenty-eight caterpillars minutely examined.
On all these segments, however, the ring-spots
were not equally developed, but increased in perfection
from the posterior towards the anterior
segments. In the larva represented in <a href="#Plate_VII">Fig. 59</a> for
example, there is a completely developed ring-spot
on segment 10, which, although possessing but a
feeble black “ground-area,” is still distinctly bordered;
on segment 9 this border is less sharp,
and not so dark, and it is still less sharp and
much lighter on segments 8 and 7, whilst
it has completely disappeared from segment 6,
the yellow “mirror” having at the same time lost
in size. On segment 5, only two small contiguous
reddish spots, the first rudiments of the
<span class="locked">nucleus,<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></span> can be recognized on close inspection.</p>

<p>Specimens in which the spots extend from the
eleventh to the seventh segment are of more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
frequent occurrence, five having been found among
the twenty-eight. In these the spots diminish
anteriorly in size, perfection, and intensity of colour.
Still more frequently (in eleven specimens) are the
ring-spots or their rudiments restricted to the
tenth and ninth segments, the spot on the latter
being without exception less developed than that
on the former segment.</p>

<p>An anteriorly progressing formation of ring-spots
thus undoubtedly occurs, the spots generally
diminishing in perfection very suddenly towards
the front segments; and specimens, such as that
represented in Fig. 60, <a href="#Plate_VII">Pl. VII</a>., in which traces of
ring-spots are to be seen on all the segments
from the tenth to the fifth, are of rare occurrence.</p>

<p>From what elements of marking are these
<i>secondary</i> ring-spots resulting from transference
developed? They do not, as in the case of the
<i>primary</i> eye-spots of the <i>Chærocampinæ</i>, originate
in the separation of one portion of the subdorsal
line, and the subsequent formation of this detached
spot into a “mirror;” but they arise from the formation
of a nucleus, first one and then two of the
shagreen-dots on the subdorsal line acquiring a
yellowish or reddish colour (Fig. 61, <a href="#Plate_VII">Pl. VII</a>., segments
6 and 7). The ground on which these two
spots are situated then becomes yellow (Fig. 61,
<a href="#Plate_VII">Pl. VII</a>., segment 8), and a more or less distinct
black border, having the form of two small crescents,
is afterwards formed. At a later period these two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
crescents and also the two primary nuclei coalesce,
producing a ring-spot which, as in Fig. 61, <a href="#Plate_VII">Pl. VII</a>.,
segment 9, can be distinctly resolved into two
portions.</p>

<p>It certainly cannot be denied that these facts
may also be theoretically interpreted in a reverse
sense. We might interpret the phenomena in this
case, as also in that of <i>D. Zygophylli</i>, as a gradual
disappearance from the front towards the hind
segments of ring-spots formerly present, a view
which could only be refuted by the ontogeny of
the species. I have not been fortunate enough to
procure eggs of <i>D. Hippophaës</i>, so that the younger
stages are unknown to me. Among my caterpillars,
however, there were two in the fourth
stage of development, but these did not show
ring-spots on all the segments, as we should expect
on the above view; on the contrary, no trace of
such spots could be seen on any of the segments
with the exception of the eleventh, on which
there was a ring-spot less perfectly developed than
in the last stage.</p>

<p>In this fourth stage the larva of <i>D. Hippophaës</i>
is of a lighter green (<a href="#Plate_VI">Fig. 58</a>), the subdorsal
yellowish with sharp boundaries, and the infra-spiracular
line pure white, as in the next stage.
The shagreening is present, but none of the
shagreen-dots are red or reddish, and no trace of
a ring-spot can be detected on the subdorsal line
with the exception of that on the eleventh segment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
In this last position this line is somewhat widened,
and a long, diffused, rose-red spot can there be
recognized upon it (<a href="#Plate_VI">Fig. 58 A</a>). The black “ground-area”
present in the fifth stage is as yet absent,
and the spot is not so sharply separated anteriorly
from the subdorsal line as it becomes later.</p>

<p>From these observations we might venture to
expect that in the third stage of <i>Hippophaës</i>, the
subdorsal line would also be free from this spot
on the eleventh segment, and it is possible that in
the second stage this line is itself absent.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">The Genus Deilephila: Summary of Facts and
Conclusions.</span></h6>

<p>Regarding only the <i>adult</i> larvæ of the species
of <i>Deilephila</i>, these represent in their five groups,
five stages in the phyletic development of the
genus; but if we also take into consideration the
developmental history, two more stages must be
added, viz., that in which the caterpillar possesses
no particular marking, as was found to be the case
in the first stage of the development of <i>D. Euphorbiæ</i>
and <i>D. Dahlii</i>; and a second stage with a subdorsal
line, but without any ring-spot formations.
Seven stages of phyletic development must therefore
be distinguished.</p>

<p><i>Stage 1.</i>&mdash;No species with entire absence of
marking in the adult form now occurs.</p>

<p><i>Stage 2.</i>&mdash;A subdorsal, accompanied by a spiracular
line, extends from the caudal horn to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
first segment. This also no longer forms the final
stage of the ontogeny, but is, however, undoubtedly
retained in the second stage of several
species (<i>D. Vespertilio</i>, <i>Livornica</i>, <i>Lineata</i>, and
perhaps also <i>Galii</i>).</p>

<p><i>Stage 3.</i>&mdash;The subdorsal line bears a ring-spot
on the penultimate segment; the other markings
as in the last stage. <i>D. Hippophaës</i> only belongs
to this stage, a small number of specimens, however,
showing a transition to the following stage
by the transference of ring-spots from the posterior
to the anterior segments.</p>

<p><i>Stage 4.</i>&mdash;Open ring-spots appear on the subdorsal
line on all the segments from the eleventh
to the first. <i>D. Zygophylli</i> and the North
American <i>D. Lineata</i> belong here.</p>

<p><i>Stage 5.</i>&mdash;Closed ring-spots are situated on the
subdorsal line. Of the known species, only <i>D.
Livornica</i> concludes its development at this phyletic
stage.</p>

<p><i>Stage 6.</i>&mdash;A single row of ring-spots replaces
the subdorsal line. <i>D. Galii</i>, <i>Vespertilio</i>, and
<i>Mauritanica</i> represent this stage at the conclusion
of their <span class="locked">ontogeny.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></span></p>

<p><i>Stage 7.</i>&mdash;A double row of ring-spots. Only
<i>D. Dahlii</i>, <i>Euphorbiæ</i>, and <i>Nicæa</i> attain to this
highest stage of <i>Deilephila</i> marking, the two first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
species in the fourth stage, and <i>Nicæa</i> in the
third stage of its ontogeny.</p>

<p>Although our knowledge of the history of the
development of the individual species is still so
fragmentary, we may conclude with certainty that
the development of the markings has been uniform
throughout&mdash;that it has proceeded in the same
manner in all species. All the species appear to
be making for the same goal, and the question
thus arises whether there may not be an innate
force urging their phyletic development. The
rigorous examination of this conception must be
reserved for a later section. Here, as we are only
occupied essentially in establishing facts, it must
be remarked that retrogression has never been
observed. The young larval forms of a species
never show the markings of a later phyletic stage
than the older larval forms; the development takes
the same course in all species, only making a
greater advance in the same direction in some
than in others.</p>

<p>Thus, <i>Nicæa</i> and <i>Euphorbiæ</i> have advanced to
the seventh phyletic stage, <i>Zygophylli</i> and <i>Hippophaës</i>
only to the third, and some specimens of
<i>Zygophylli</i> to the fourth. But at whatever
phyletic stage the ontogeny of a species may
terminate, the young larval stages always display
the older phyletic stages. Thus, <i>Galii</i> in its last
ontogenetic stage reaches the <i>sixth</i> phyletic stage;
in its penultimate stage it reaches the <i>fifth</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
phyletic stage; and in its third stage; the <i>fourth</i>
phyletic stage is represented, so that little imagination
is required to anticipate that in the second
stage the <i>third</i> or <i>second</i> phyletic stage would be
pictured.</p>

<p>If we tabulate the development of the various
species, indicating the ontogenetic stages by
Arabic numerals, and the stages of the phylogeny
which are reached in each stage of the ontogeny
by Roman numerals, we obtain a useful synopsis
of the series of developments, and, at the same
time, it shows how many gaps still remain to be
filled up in order to complete our knowledge even
of this small group of species.</p>

From this very incomplete table we perceive
that, in certain instances, the stages can be represented
as a continuous series of phyletic steps, as
in the case of <i>D. Galii</i>; that in others certain steps
may be omitted, as with <i>D. Euphorbiæ</i>, in which
grade I. of stage 1 is immediately followed by
grade V. in stage 2. In reality the gap caused
by this omission is still greater than would appear,
as grade V. is only indicated, and not actually
reached, the subdorsal not being present as a
sharply-defined line, but only as a faint stripe.
The suppression of phyletic steps increases with
the advancement in phyletic development. The
higher the step to which a species finally attains,
the greater is the tendency of the initial stages to
be compressed, or omitted altogether.</p>

<p>From what has thus far been seen with respect
to the development of <i>D. Hippophaës</i>, there may
be drawn what to me appears to be a very
important conclusion, viz. that the ring-spots
of <i>Deilephila</i> first originated on the segment
bearing the caudal horn, and were then gradually
transferred as secondary spots to the preceding
segments. Complete certainty would be given to
this conclusion by a knowledge of the young
forms of other phyletically retarded species, especially
those of the American <i>D. Lineata</i>, and
perhaps also those of <i>Zygophylli</i> and <i>Livornica</i>.
The few observations on the development of
<i>D. Galii</i> already recorded give support to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
view, since the absence of ring-spots on the three
front segments in the young caterpillar (one
instance), or their less perfect formation on these
segments (second instance), indicates a forward
transference of the spots.</p>

<p>If the foregoing view be accepted, there follows
from it a fundamental difference between the
development of the genera <i>Chærocampa</i> and
<i>Deilephila</i>. In the former the formation of the
eye-spots proceeds from a subdorsal line, but they
first appear on two of the front segments, and are
then transferred to the <i>posterior</i> segments. In
<i>Deilephila</i>, on the other hand, a single ring-spot
is formed on the penultimate segment bearing the
caudal horn, and this is repeated on the <i>anterior</i>
segments by secondary transference. With respect
to the origination of the ring-spot also, there is a
distinction between this genus and <i>Chærocampa</i>,
inasmuch as the first step towards the eye-formation
in the latter consists in the separation of
a curved portion of the subdorsal line, whilst in
<i>Deilephila</i> the nuclear spot first seems to originate
and the separation of the mirror-spot from the
subdorsal line appears to occur secondarily. It is
difficult here to draw further conclusions, since the
first appearance of the primary ring-spot has not
yet been observed, and no more certain inference
respecting the history of the formation of the
<i>primary</i> ring-spots can be drawn from the manner
in which the <i>secondary</i> ring-spots are formed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
Because in <i>Hippophaës</i> the formation of the
secondary ring-spots begins with the red coloration
of one or two shagreen-dots, it does not follow
that the primary spot on the eleventh segment also
originated in this manner; and this is not without
importance when we are concerned with the causes
which underlie the formation of ring-spots. In
<i>Chærocampa</i> also, the formation of the primary
eye-spots appears to differ from that of the
secondary&mdash;in the latter the black “ground-area”
first appearing, and in the former the “mirror-spot.”
The secondary eye-spots certainly remain
rudimentary in this last genus, so that the
evidence in support of this conclusion is thus much
weakened; but it must be admitted that we are
here on ground still too uncertain to admit of
wider conclusions being based thereon.</p>

<p>As a final result of the investigation, we may
advance the opinion that the existing species of
the genus <i>Deilephila</i> have reached five different
phyletic stages, and that their very different
external appearance is explained by their different
phyletic ages; the appearance from these caterpillars
of moths so extremely similar, can otherwise
be scarcely understood.</p>

<p>It may appear almost unnecessary to bring
forward additional proofs in support of this interpretation
of the facts, but in a field where the
data are so scanty, no argument which can be
drawn from them should be considered as superfluous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
The variations which occasionally occur
in the larvæ, however, to a certain extent furnish
a proof of the correctness of the theoretical interpretation
offered.</p>

<p>When, in the ontogeny of these species, we
actually see before us a series of stages of phyletic
development, we must admit that ordinary reversion
may occur, causing an adult caterpillar to
show the characters of the young. Forms
reverting to an earlier phyletic stage must, on the
whole, occur but seldom, as this stage is removed
further back in the ontogeny. Thus, indications
of the subdorsal line must occur but rarely in the
<i>adult</i> larvæ of <i>Euphorbiæ</i>, and still less frequently
in <i>Nicæa</i>, whilst they must be expected to be of
more common occurrence in <i>Vespertilio</i>, and also,
as has already been seen, in <i>Dahlii</i>. In this last
species, as also in <i>Vespertilio</i>, the completely-developed
subdorsal line is still present in the
third stage, whilst it is possessed by <i>Euphorbiæ</i>
only in the second stage, and then in a rudimentary
condition.</p>

<p>The state of affairs may in fact be thus described:
Among several hundred adult larvæ of
<i>Dahlii</i> found in Sardinia by Dr. Staudinger, there
were some which did not actually possess a distinct
subdorsal line, but in place thereof, and as its
last indication, a feeble light stripe. One of Dr.
Staudinger’s caterpillars showed also a distinct
line between the closed eye-spots. In the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
stage of <i>Vespertilio</i> this line appears still more
frequently, whilst in <i>Euphorbiæ</i> it is extremely
rare, and when present it only appears as a faint
indication. This is the case with one of the
specimens figured in Hübner’s work as an “aberration,”
and also with one in Dr. Staudinger’s
collection. Of <i>Nicæa</i> I have at most seen only
eight specimens, none of which showed any trace
of the long-vanished subdorsal line.</p>

<p>It must be expected that any ontogenetic stage
would most readily revert to the preceding phyletic
stage, so that characters present in the preceding
stage are consequently those which would most
commonly arise by reversion. This postulate of
the theory also finds confirmation in the facts.
Caterpillars which, when full grown, belong to the
<i>seventh</i> phyletic stage, <i>e.g.</i> <i>D. Euphorbiæ</i>, not
unfrequently show variations corresponding to the
<i>sixth</i> stage, <i>i.e.</i> only one instead of two rows of
ring-spots&mdash;the upper and first-appearing series.
On the other hand, forms reverting to the <i>fifth</i>
phyletic stage (ring-spots with connecting subdorsal
line) occur but very rarely. I have never
met with such cases in adult living caterpillars of
<i>D. Euphorbiæ</i>, although in one instance such a
larva was found in the fourth ontogenetic stage;
but the strikingly dark, brownish subdorsal line
which connected the otherwise perfectly developed
ring-spots, completely disappeared in the fifth stage
of the ontogeny. Those larvæ which, in the adult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
state, belong to the <i>sixth</i> phyletic stage, not
unfrequently show the characters of the <i>fifth</i> stage
more or less developed, as, for example, <i>D. Vespertilio</i>.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></p>

<h5>THE GENUS SMERINTHUS, LATREILLE.</h5>

<p>The caterpillars of this genus are very similar
in appearance, and all possess extremely simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
markings. The occurrence of numerous stages of
development of these markings is thus excluded,
and the study of the ontogeny therefore promised
to furnish less information concerning the phyletic
development of the genus than in the case of the
preceding genera. This investigation has nevertheless
also yielded interesting results, and the
facts here recorded will be found of value in likewise
throwing light on the causes which have
produced the markings of caterpillars.</p>

<p>I shall commence, as in former cases, with the
developmental history. I have easily been able to
obtain fertile eggs of all the species of <i>Smerinthus</i>
known to me. Impregnated females laid large
numbers of eggs in confinement, and also bred
females of the commoner species can readily be
made to copulate, when pinned, and exposed in a
suitable place in the open air. A male soon
appears under these circumstances, and copulation
is effected as readily as though the insect were not
fastened in the way indicated.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Smerinthus Tiliæ</span>, <span class="smcap">Linn.</span><a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></h6>

<p>The light green eggs are nearly spherical, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
after fourteen days (beginning of July) the young
larvæ emerge. These are also of a light green
colour, and are conspicuous for the great length
of the caudal horn, which is nearly half as long as
the body. This horn is likewise of a light green
at first, but becomes dark violet in the course of
an hour. No trace of any markings can be
detected at this stage.</p>

<p>As soon as the caterpillars are hatched they
commence to nibble the empty egg shells; then
they run about with great activity, and after
several hours take up their position on the largest
vein on the under side of the lime leaves, where
they remain for a long period. In this situation
they have the same form and colour as the leaf-vein,
and are very difficult to discover, which
would not be the case if they reposed obliquely or
transversely to the vein. In about 4&ndash;5 days
the caterpillars undergo their first moult, and
enter upon the second stage. On each side of
the segments 11&ndash;4, there now appear seven
oblique whitish stripes on a somewhat darker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
green ground; these slope in the direction of the
caudal horn. Owing to the transparency of the
skin, a dark green dorsal line appears in the position
of the underlying dorsal vessel, the green
contents of the alimentary canal being distinctly
visible through the absence of adipose matter in
the tissues. The larvæ possess also a fine whitish
subdorsal line, which extends from the horn to the
head. The horn at this stage becomes black with
a yellowish red base.</p>

<p>In the third stage, which occurs after six or seven
days, the oblique stripes appear darker, and the
subdorsal line disappears.</p>

<p class="h7"><i>Fourth Stage.</i></p>

<p>After another period of 4&ndash;5 days the third
moult takes place, and there now commences
a dimorphism which will perhaps be better designated
as variability, since the two extremes are
connected by transitional forms. The majority of
the larvæ have, as in the preceding stage, pure
white oblique stripes, but many of them possess a
blood-red spot on the anterior side of the stripes,
this spot showing all gradations in size and depth
of colour between maximum development and a
mere trace. Special interest attaches to these
spots, as they are the first rudiments of the coloured
border of the oblique stripes which occurs in so
many <i>Sphinx</i> caterpillars.</p>

<p>In the fifth stage&mdash;the last of the larval development&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
red spots become more strongly
pronounced. Among eighty caterpillars from one
brood there were about twenty without any red
whilst the remainder were ornamented with more
or less vivid blood-red spots, often large and irregular
in form. In some specimens the spots had
become drawn out into <span class="locked">lines,<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></span> forming a coloured
edge to the oblique white stripes, similar to that
possessed by the larva of <i>Sphinx Ligustri</i>. The
caterpillar is thus represented in many figures, but
generally the coloured stripe is made too regular,
as in reality it is always irregularly defined above,
and never so sharp and even as in <i>Sphinx
Ligustri</i>. The character is here obviously not yet
perfected, but is still in a state of development.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Smerinthus Populi</span>, <span class="smcap">Linn</span>.</h6>

<p>From green spherical eggs there emerged larvæ
6.5 millimeters in length without any markings.
They were of a light greenish-white, the large head
and long caudal horn being of the same colour.
The posterior boundary of the segments appears
as a light shining ring (<a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI</a>. Fig. 55).</p>

<p>The characteristic markings of the genus appear
on the following day without the occurrence of any
moult: seven oblique white stripes arise from near
the dorsal line, and extend along the sides in a
direction parallel to that of the horn. On the
three front segments they are represented only by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
three small white spots (<a href="#Plate_VI">Fig. 56</a>). The caterpillar
likewise possesses a marking of which the
adult species of the genus retain only a trace,
viz., a well-developed, pure white subdorsal line,
which is crossed by the six anterior oblique stripes,
and uniting with the upper part of the seventh
extends to the caudal horn.</p>

<p>I long believed that the markings described were
first acquired in the second stage, as I was possessed
with the generally accepted idea that the changes
of form and colour in insects could only occur at
the period of ecdysis. I at first thought that the
moult had escaped my notice, and I was only
undeceived by close observation of individual
specimens.</p>

<p class="h7"><i>Second Stage.</i></p>

<p>The first moult took place after five days, the
larvæ being 1.4 centimeters in length. Only unimportant
changes of marking are connected therewith.
The subdorsal line loses much in thickness
and definition, and the first and last of the oblique
stripes become considerably broader than the
intermediate ones (<a href="#Plate_VI">Fig. 57</a>). The green ground
colour and also the stripes acquire a yellowish
hue.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there occur changes in form.
The head, which was at first rounded, becomes of
the characteristic triangular shape, with the apex
upwards, common to all the species of the genus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
and at the same time acquires two white lines,
which unite above at the apex of the angle. The
shagreening of the skin now also takes place,
and the red spot at the base of the horn is formed.</p>

<p>There appears to be at this stage a general
tendency for the suffusion of red, the thoracic legs
also becoming of this colour.</p>

<p class="h7"><i>Third Stage.</i></p>

<p>The second moult occurs after six or eight days,
the marking only changing to the extent of the
subdorsal line becoming still more indistinct. This
line can now only be distinctly recognized on the
three front segments in a few individuals, whilst
in the majority it is completely absent. Sometimes
the ferruginous red spots on the oblique
stripes now appear, but this character is not completely
developed till the fifth stage. Out of about
ninety bred specimens in which I followed the
entire development, only one possessed such spots,
and these were situated on both sides of the sixth
segment.</p>

<p class="h7"><i>Fourth Stage.</i></p>

<p>The third moult, which takes place after another
period of six days, is not associated with any change
of marking.</p>

<p>In this stage also I observed in one specimen
(not the one just mentioned) the ferruginous spots,
and again only on the sixth segment. On account
of the theoretical conclusions which may be drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
from this localization of the spots&mdash;supposing it to
be of general occurrence&mdash;it becomes of importance
to institute observations with different broods, so
as to investigate their first appearance, frequency,
and local limitation. It appears to me very probable
that, with respect to frequency and time of
appearance, there would be great differences, since,
in the last stage, it is just this character which shows
a great variability. It would be more remarkable
if it should be established that the first appearance
of the spots was always limited to a certain segment;
and there would then be a great analogy
with the first appearance of the eye-spots in
<i>Chærocampa</i> and the ring-spots in <i>Deilephila</i>.</p>

<p class="h7"><i>Fifth Stage.</i></p>

<p>The adult caterpillar does not differ in marking
to any considerable extent from the preceding
stages. The first and last stripes do not appear
larger than the intermediate ones, as the latter
now increase in size. Many specimens were
entirely without red spots; in others they were
present, but were small and inconspicuous, whilst
in others again there were two spots, one above
the other, of a vivid ferruginous red, these
coalescing in some cases, and thus forming one
spot of a considerable size. I have never seen
these spots formed into a regular, linear, coloured
border to the white oblique stripes&mdash;as occasionally
happens in <i>Tiliæ</i>&mdash;either in living specimens,
blown larvæ, or in figures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Smerinthus Ocellatus, Linn.</span></h6>

<p>The green eggs much resemble those of <i>Populi</i>,
as also do the newly hatched caterpillars, which, as
in the case of this last species, are entirely without
markings. As with <i>Populi</i>, the markings are
formed in the course of the first stage, and are
distinctly visible before the first moult. The long
caudal horn is of a red colour.</p>

<p>After two to three days the caterpillars moult,
their length then being one centimeter; the seven
beautiful oblique white stripes, and the fine white
subdorsal line, are more strongly pronounced, the
latter becoming broader in front. They differ
from <i>Populi</i> in having the oblique stripes united
in the dorsal line.</p>

<p>The second moult occurs after another three
days, and brings no important change; only the
fine subdorsal line becoming somewhat fainter.
Neither is the third moult, which takes place four
days later, associated with the appearance of any
essentially new character. The oblique stripes
remain as before, but their upper portions now
stand on a somewhat darker green ground-colour,
whilst the subdorsal line vanishes, leaving distinct
traces only on the three or four front segments.</p>

<p>The fourth moult follows after a period of seven
days, and my bred larvæ underwent scarcely any
alteration in marking. Only small differences in
coloration became perceptible in the head and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
horn, these changing to bluish. Specimens occur,
although but rarely, which show in this last stage
red spots in the vicinity of the oblique stripes, just
in the same manner as with <i>Populi</i>, in which
species, however, they occur more commonly. I
only once found an adult larva of <i>Ocellatus</i>
possessing reddish-brown spots above and below
the oblique <span class="locked">stripes,<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></span> exactly as in one of the
specimens figured by Rösel.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
In this stage also there remains almost always
on the three to six front segments, a more or
less distinct residue of the subdorsal, which extends
backwards from the head as a whitish line
intersecting the foremost oblique stripes. (Fig.
70, <a href="#Plate_VII">Pl. VII</a>.)</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Results of the Developmental History of Smerinthus
Tiliæ, Populi and Ocellatus.</span></h6>

<p>From the meagre materials furnished by these
three obviously nearly related species, we may at
least conclude that, with respect to marking, three
stages of development can be distinguished:&mdash;(1)
Simple (green) coloration without marking;
(2) subdorsal lines crossed by seven pairs of oblique
stripes; (3) more or less complete absence of the
subdorsal lines, the oblique stripes remaining, and
showing a tendency to become edged with a
red border.</p>

<p>Which of the three species is the oldest I will
not attempt to decide. If we might venture to
form any conclusion from the frequency of the
red spots, <i>Tiliæ</i> would be the youngest, <i>i.e.</i>, the
species which has made the farthest advance. But
this does not agree with the fact that the oblique
stripes appear somewhat later in this species.
Both these distinctions are, however, too unimportant
to enable us to build certain conclusions
on them. Neither does a comparison of the adult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
larvæ with other species of <i>Smerinthus</i> furnish any
further information of importance.</p>

<p>Of the genus <i>Smerinthus</i>, Latr., thirty species
were catalogued by <span class="locked">Gray,<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></span> of which I am only acquainted
with the larvæ of eight (five European,
and three North American). None of these in the
last stage possess a complete subdorsal line together
with oblique stripes. Neither, on the other
hand, do any of them show a more advanced
stage of development in having the red spots constantly
formed into coloured border-stripes. We
must therefore admit that they have all reached
nearly the same stage of phyletic development.
On turning to the doubtfully placed genus <i>Calymnia</i>,
Boisduval, which is represented in Gray by
only one species, figured by <span class="locked">Westwood<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></span> as a
<i>Smerinthus</i>, we first meet with an older stage of
development of the genus.</p>

<p>The adult caterpillar of <i>C. Panopus</i>, from the
East Indies, possesses, in addition to the oblique
stripes, a completely developed subdorsal <span class="locked">line,<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
and thus corresponds to the first stage of <i>S. Populi</i>.
This species may possibly retain in its ontogeny
a stage in which the oblique stripes are also absent,
whilst the subdorsal line is present. From the early
disappearance of the subdorsal line in the species
of <i>Smerinthus</i>, we may venture to conclude that
this character appeared at an early stage of the
phylogeny, whilst the oblique stripes represent
a secondary form of marking, as shall be further
established <span class="locked">subsequently.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span></p>

<h5>THE GENUS MACROGLOSSA, OCHSENHEIMER.</h5>

<p>The adult larvæ of five species are known, and
to these I can now add a sixth. In Gray the
genus contains twenty-six <span class="locked">species.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></span> I cannot find
any figures or descriptions of the young stages of
these caterpillars, and I have myself only observed
the complete ontogeny of one species.</p>

<p>By placing a captured female <i>M. Stellatarum</i> in
a capacious breeding-cage, in the open air, I was
enabled to procure eggs. The moth hovered
about over the flowers, and laid its small, grass-green,
spherical eggs (partly when on the wing),
singly, on the leaves, buds, and stalks of <i>Galium
Mollugo</i>. Altogether 130 were obtained in three
<span class="locked">days.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span></p>

<p class="h7"><i>First Stage.</i></p>

<p>After about eight days the caterpillars emerge.
They are only two millimeters in length, and are at
first yellowish, but soon become green, set with small
single bristles, and they possess a short greenish
caudal horn, which afterwards becomes black.
The head is greenish-yellow. The young larvæ
are entirely destitute of marking. (<a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III</a>.,
Fig. 1).</p>

<p class="h7"><i>Second Stage.</i></p>

<p>The first moult takes place after four days, the
caterpillar now acquiring the marking which it
essentially retains to pupation.</p>

<p>Fine white subdorsal and spiracular lines appear,
and at the same time a dark green dorsal
line, which, however, does not arise from the deposition
of pigment, as is generally the case, but
from a division in the folds of the fatty tissue along
this position. (Fig. 2, <a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III</a>.)</p>

<p>The colour is now dirty green in all specimens,
the skin being finely shagreened.</p>

<p class="h7"><i>Third Stage.</i></p>

<p>The second moult, occurring after another
period of four days, does not bring any change of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
marking, the colour only becoming somewhat
darker. Length, twelve millimeters.</p>

<p class="h7"><i>Fourth Stage.</i></p>

<p>The third moult (after another four days) likewise
brings only a change of colouring, which is of
such a nature that the caterpillar becomes dimorphic.
At the same time that peculiar roughening
of the skin takes place which, in the case of <i>Chærocampa</i>,
was designated as “shagreening.” The
colour is now light grass-green in some specimens,
and dark green in others; in these last the subdorsal
line is edged above with dark brown, and
the spiracles are also of this colour. Length,
seventeen millimeters.</p>

<p class="h7"><i>Fifth Stage.</i></p>

<p>Four days later, after the fourth ecdysis, the
dimorphism becomes a polymorphism. Five chief
types can be <span class="locked">distinguished:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Variety I.</i>&mdash;Light green (Fig. 7, <a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III</a>.); dorsal
line, blackish-green, strongly marked; subdorsal
line broad, pure white, edged above with dark
green; spiracular line, chrome-yellow; horn,
black, with yellow tip and blue sides. Spiracles,
blackish-brown, with narrow yellow border; legs,
and extremities of prolegs, vermilion-red.</p>

<p><i>Variety II.</i>&mdash;Blackish-brown (Fig. 6, <a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III</a>.);
head and prothorax, yellowish-brown; markings
the same as above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
<i>Variety III.</i>&mdash;Blackish-green or greenish-black
(Figs. 10 and 11, <a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III</a>.); subdorsal line with
blackish-green border above, gradually passing into
a light green ground-colour; spiracular line, chrome-yellow;
head and prothorax, greenish-yellow.</p>

<p><i>Variety IV.</i>&mdash;Light green (Figs. 4 and 12, <a href="#Plate_III">Pl.
III</a>.); dorsal line quite feeble; subdorsal broad,
only faintly edged with dark green; subspiracular
line, faint yellowish; head and prothorax,
green.</p>

<p><i>Variety V.</i>&mdash;Brownish-violet (Fig. 8, <a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III</a>.);
the black dorsal line on a reddish ground either
narrow or broad.</p>

<p>From these five varieties we see that the different
types do not stand immediately next to
one another; they are, in fact, connected by
numerous transitional forms, the ground-colour
varying greatly, being dark or light, yellowish or
bluish. (Compare <a href="#Plate_III">Figs. 4</a>, 5, 7, and 12.) The
markings remain the same in all, but may be of
very different intensities. The dorsal line is often
only very feebly indicated, and the subdorsal line
is frequently but faintly edged; the latter is also
sometimes deep black above and bordered rather
darkly beneath, the sides then being of a dark
green, often with blackish dots on the yellow
spiracular line (Fig. 5, <a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III</a>.), this likewise
being frequently edged with black. Only the
horn and legs are alike in all forms. The green
ground-colour passes into blackish-green, greenish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
or brownish-black, and again, from reddish-brown
to lilac (<a href="#Plate_III">Fig. 3</a>), this last being the rarest
colour.</p>

<p>The designation “polymorphism” may here
appear very inapplicable, since we have no sharply
distinct forms, but five very variable ground-colours
connected by numerous intermediate modes
of coloration. Should, however, the term “variability”
be suggested, I am in possession of an
observation which tends to show that the different
colours have to a certain extent become
fixed. I found a brown caterpillar, the five front
segments of which were light green on the left
side, and the fifth segment brown and green
mixed (Fig. 9, <a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III</a>.). Such parti-coloration can
evidently only appear where we have contending
characters which cannot become combined; just as
in the case of hermaphrodite bees, where one half
of a segment is male and the other half female,
the two characters never becoming fused so as to
produce a truly intermediate <span class="locked">form.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></span> From this
observation, I conclude that some of the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
varieties of <i>Stellatarum</i> have already become
so far removed from one another that they must
be regarded as intermediate fixed forms, the colours
of which no longer become fused together when
they occur in one individual, but are developed
in adjacent regions. Other facts agree with this
conclusion. Thus, among the 140 adult larvæ
which I bred from the batch of eggs above
mentioned, the transition forms were much in
the minority. There were forty-nine green and
sixty-three brown caterpillars, whilst only twenty-eight
were more or less transitional.</p>

<p>On these grounds I designate the phenomenon
as “polymorphism,” although it may not yet have
reached, as such, its sharpest limits. This would
be brought about by the elimination of the intermediate
<span class="locked">forms.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
Immediately before pupation, all the caterpillars,
both green and brown, acquire a lilac coloration.
The fifth stage lasts seven days, and the whole
larval development twenty-three days, the period
from the deposition of the eggs to the appearance
of the moth being only thirty-one days.</p>

<p>I have treated of the polymorphism of <i>Stellatarum</i>
in detail, not only because it has hitherto
remained unknown, and an analysis of such cases
has been completely <span class="locked">ignored,<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></span> but more particularly
because, it appears to me, that important
conclusions can be drawn therefrom. Moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
such an extreme multiplicity of forms is interesting,
since, so far as I know, polymorphism to this
extent has not been observed in any insect.</p>

<p>The theoretical bearing of this polymorphism
will be treated of subsequently. It is not in any
way connected with a more advanced development
of the markings, since <i>M. Stellatarum</i> shows in
this respect a very low state of development. This
species displays only two stages:&mdash;(1), complete
absence of all markings; and (2), a simple subdorsal,
with dorsal and spiracular lines. We must therefore
admit that the phyletic development of the
markings has for a long time remained at a standstill,
or, what expresses the same thing, that the
marking which the adult larva now possesses is
extremely old.</p>

<p>In order to complete my observations on <i>M.
Stellatarum</i>, I now add some remarks on the
pupa, the colour variations of which it appeared of
importance to investigate, owing to the extraordinary
variability of the caterpillar. The pupa varies
but very slightly; the ochreous yellow ground-colour
sometimes passes into reddish, and sometimes
into greenish; the rather complicated blackish-brown
marking of streaky lines is very constant,
especially on the wing portions, being at
most only more or less strongly pronounced. The
minute colour variations of the pupa therefore have
no connection with the colour of the caterpillar,
both green and brown larvæ furnishing sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
reddish-yellow and sometimes greenish-yellow
pupæ.</p>

<p>The comparison of <i>M. Stellatarum</i> with the
other known species of the genus, brings scarcely
any addition to our knowledge of the phyletic
development. Thus, the two European species of
which the caterpillars are known, viz. <i>M. Fuciformis</i>
and <i>Bombyliformis</i>,<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> show essentially the same
markings as <i>Stellatarum</i>, the chief element being
a well-developed subdorsal line. The Indian <i>M.
Gilia</i>, Herrich-Schäf., possesses also this <span class="locked">line,<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></span> and,
together with the East Indian <i>M. Corythus</i>, <span class="locked">Walk.,<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></span>
has oblique stripes in addition; the stripes do not,
however, cross this line, but commence underneath
it, and probably originated at a later period than the
subdorsal line. Should this be the case, we must
regard <i>M. Corythus</i> as representing a later phyletic
stage. According to Duponchel’s figures, in both
<i>M. Fuciformis</i> and <i>Bombyliformis</i> small oblique
stripes (red) occur near the spiracles, but these
have nothing to do with the oblique stripes of <i>M.
Gilia</i> just mentioned, as they run in a contrary
direction. Of the two European species, I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
only seen the living caterpillar of <i>Fuciformis</i>, and
this possessed no oblique stripes.</p>

<p>To these five species I am now enabled to add
a sixth, viz. <i>Macroglossa Croatica</i>,<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> a species
inhabiting Asia Minor and Eastern Europe, of
which a specimen and notice were kindly forwarded
to me by Dr. Staudinger. The adult caterpillar
much resembles that of <i>M. Stellatarum</i> in form and
marking, but the subdorsal line appears much
less distinctly defined, and the dorsal and spiracular
lines seem to be entirely absent. The colour is
generally green, but varies to red, and the subdorsal
is more distinct and sharper in the young
than in the adult larva. The markings of this
species do not therefore in any way surpass those
of <i>Stellatarum</i>, but are, on the contrary, much
<span class="locked">simpler.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span></p>

<h5>THE GENUS PTEROGON, <span class="locked">BOISD.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></span></h5>

<p>Although I am acquainted with only a small
portion of the developmental history of a single
species of this genus, I will here proceed to record
this fragment, since, taken in connection with two
other species, it appears to me sufficient to determine,
at least broadly, the direction of development
which this genus has taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Pterogon Œnotheræ, Fabr.</span></h6>

<p>The adult larva, as made known by many, and
for the most part good figures, has very complicated
markings, which do not seem derivable from any
of the elements of marking in the <i>Sphingidæ</i>
hitherto considered. I was therefore much surprised
at finding a young caterpillar of this
species, only twelve millimeters in length, of
a light green colour, without any trace of the
subsequent latticed marking, and with a broad
white subdorsal line extending along all the twelve
segments. (<a href="#Plate_VII">Pl. VII</a>., Fig. 63). Judging from the
size and subsequent development, this caterpillar
was probably in the third stage.</p>

<p>The same colouring and marking remained
during the following (fourth) stage; but in the
position occupied by the caudal horn in other
<i>Sphingidæ</i>, there could now be observed the rudiment
of a future ocellus in the form of a round
yellowish spot (<a href="#Plate_VII">Pl. VII</a>., Fig. 64). The subdorsal
line disappears suddenly in the fifth stage, when
the larva becomes dark green (rarely) or blackish-brown;
the latticed marking and the small oblique
stripes are also acquired, together with the beautifully
developed eye-spots, consisting of a yellow
mirror with black nucleus and ground-area (<a href="#Plate_VII">Pl.
VII</a>., Fig. 65).</p>

<p>The North American <i>Pterogon Gauræ</i> and <i>P.
Abboti</i><a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> also show markings precisely similar to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
those of this European species in the adult state;
but in the two former the markings are of special
interest as indicating the manner in which the
primary Sphinx-marking has become transformed
into that of the apparently totally different adult
<i>P. Œnotheræ</i>. <i>P. Gauræ</i> is green, with a complicated
latticed marking, which closer observation
shows to arise from the dorsal line being resolved
into small black dots, whilst the subdorsal line is
broken up into black, white-bordered triangles.
This caterpillar therefore gives fresh support to
the remarkable phenomenon that the animals as
well as the plants of North America are phyletically
older than the European fauna and flora, a
view which also appeared similarly confirmed by
<i>Deilephila Lineata</i>, the representative form of
<i>D. Livornica</i>. In entire accordance with this is
the fact that the larva of <i>P. Gauræ</i> is without
the eye-spot on the eleventh segment, and instead
thereof still shows the original although small
caudal horn. The perfect insect also resembles
our <i>P. Œnotheræ</i> in colour and marking, but not
in the form of the wings.</p>

<p>That the caterpillars of the genus <i>Pterogon</i>
originally possessed the caudal horn we learn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
from <i>P. Gorgoniades</i>, Hübn.,<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> a species now
inhabiting south-east Russia, and for a knowledge
of which I am indebted to Dr. Staudinger’s collection.
There are in this about eight blown specimens,
from 3.7 to 3.9 centimeters in length, which
show a marking, sometimes on a red and sometimes
on a green ground, which unites this species
with the young form of <i>P. Œnotheræ</i>, viz., a broad
white subdorsal line, extending from the small
caudal horn to the head. In addition to this, however,
the caterpillar possesses an extraordinarily
broad white red-bordered infra-spiracular line, a
fine white dorsal stripe, and a similar line between
the subdorsal and spiracular, <i>i.e.</i> a supra-spiracular
line.</p>

<p>The caterpillars in Staudinger’s collection, notwithstanding
their small size, all belong to the last
stage, as the moth itself does not measure more
than 2.6 centimeters in expanse, and is therefore
among the smallest of the known <i>Sphingidæ</i>.
This species has therefore in the adult condition a
marking very similar to that of <i>Œnotheræ</i> when
young&mdash;it bears to <i>Œnotheræ</i> the same relationship
that <i>Deilephila Hippophaës</i> does to <i>D. Euphorbiæ</i>,
only in the present case the interval between the
two species is greater. <i>Gorgoniades</i> is obviously
a phyletically older species, as we perceive from
the marking and from the possession of a horn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
We certainly do not yet know whether <i>Œnotheræ</i>
possesses a horn in its earliest stages, although in
all probability it does so; in any case the ancestor
of <i>Œnotheræ</i> had a horn, since the closely allied
<i>P. Gauræ</i> now possesses one.</p>

<p>We thus see that also in the genus <i>Pterogon</i>
the marking of the caterpillars commences with a
longitudinal line formed from the subdorsal; an
infra-spiracular or also a supra-spiracular line
(<i>Gorgoniades</i>) being added. A latticed marking is
developed from the linear marking by the breaking
up of the latter into spots or small patches,
which finally (in <i>Œnotheræ</i>) become completely
independent, their connection with the linear marking
being no longer directly perceptible.</p>

<h5>THE GENUS SPHINX, LINN.</h5>

<p>Of this genus (in the narrow sense employed
by Gray) I have only been able, in spite of all
trouble, to obtain fertile eggs of one species.
The females cannot be induced to lay in confinement,
and eggs can only be obtained by chance.</p>

<p>I long searched in vain the literature of this
subject for some account of the young stages of
these caterpillars, and at length found, in a note to
Rösel’s work, an observation of Kleemann’s on the
young forms of <i>Sphinx Ligustri</i>, which, although
far from complete, throws light on certain points.</p>

<p>From a female of <i>S. Ligustri</i> Kleemann obtained
400 fertile eggs. The caterpillars on emerging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
are “at first entirely light yellowish-green, but
become greener after feeding on the fresh leaves;”
the horn is also at first light green, and then
becomes “darker.” The young larvæ spin webs,
by which they fasten themselves to the leaves of
their food-plant (this, so far as I know, has not
been observed in any species of <i>Sphingidæ</i>).
They moult four times, the border round the head
and the purple stripes appearing after the third
moult, these stripes “having previously been
entirely white.” The ecdyses follow at intervals
of about six days, increasing to about ten days
after the fourth <span class="locked">moult.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></span></p>

<p>From this short account we gather that in the
third stage the marking consists of seven oblique
white stripes, which acquire coloured edges in the
fourth stage, a fact which I have myself frequently
observed. On the most important point Kleemann’s
observations unfortunately give no information&mdash;the
presence or absence of a subdorsal
line in the youngest stages. That he does not
mention this character, can in no way be considered
as a proof of its actual absence. I am rather
inclined to believe that it is present in the first, and
perhaps also in the second stage. There occur,
however, species of the genus <i>Sphinx</i> (<i>sensû strictiori</i>)
which possess a subdorsal line when young,
as I think may be certainly inferred from the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
that the remains of such a line are present in the
adult larva of <i>S. Convolvuli</i>.</p>

<p>This conclusion becomes still more certain on
comparing the markings with those of a nearly
allied genus; without such comparison the separation
of the genus <i>Macrosila</i>, Boisd., from <i>Sphinx</i> is
scarcely justifiable. If to these two genera we
add <i>Dolba</i>, Walk., and <i>Acherontia</i>, Ochs., we must
be principally struck with the great similarity in
the markings, which often reaches to such an
extent that the differences between two species
consist entirely in small shades of colour, while the
divergence of the moths is far greater.</p>

<p>Of the genera mentioned, I am acquainted altogether
with fourteen species of caterpillars:&mdash;<i>Macrosila
Hasdrubal</i>, <i>Rustica</i>,<a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> and <i>Cingulata</i>;<a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a>
<i>Sphinx Convolvuli</i>, <i>Ligustri</i>, <i>Carolina</i>,<a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> <i>Quinquemaculata</i>,<a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a>
<i>Drupiferarum</i>,<a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> <i>Kalmiæ</i>,<a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> and
<i>Gordius</i>;<a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> <i>Dolba Hylæus</i>;<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> <i>Acherontia Atropos</i>,
<i>Styx</i>,<a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> and <i>Satanas</i>.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> With one exception all
these caterpillars possess oblique stripes of the
nature of those of the <i>Smerinthus</i> larvæ, and most of
them are without any trace of a subdorsal line; one
species&mdash;the North American <i>M. Cingulata</i>&mdash;has
a completely developed subdorsal; and the typical
European species, <i>S. Convolvuli</i>, has a rudimentary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
subdorsal line. The ground-colour in most of
these species is of the same green as that of the
leaves of their food-plants; some are brown, <i>i.e.</i>
earth-coloured, and in these the markings do not
appear so prominently; others again possess very
striking colours (<i>A. Atropos</i>), the oblique stripes
in these cases being very vivid. Only <i>M. Hasdrubal</i><a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a>
separates itself completely from this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
system of classification, since this species is deep
black with narrow yellow rings, the horn and last
segment being red.</p>

<p>The large and most striking caterpillar of <i>M.
Hasdrubal</i> is the same which Wallace has made
use of for his theory of the brilliant colours of
caterpillars. The explanation of the origin of
this widely divergent mode of marking could only
be furnished by the ontogeny, in which one or
another of the older phyletic stages will certainly
have been preserved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
Strictly speaking the same should be said of
the other species&mdash;nevertheless their comparison
with the so similarly marked <i>Smerinthinæ</i>, together
with the circumstance that in certain species
a subdorsal line can be traced, makes it appear
correct to suppose that here also the subdorsal
was the primary marking, this line being subsequently
entirely replaced by the oblique stripes.
The <i>Sphinginæ</i> would therefore be a younger
group than the <i>Smerinthinæ</i>, a conclusion which
is borne out by the fact that in the former the
oblique stripes have reached a higher development,
being always of two, and sometimes even of three
colours (<i>S. Drupiferarum</i>, white, red, black), whilst
in the species of <i>Smerinthus</i> they only occasionally
possess uniformly coloured borders.</p>

<h5>THE GENUS ANCERYX, BOISD.</h5>

<p>Although this genus is not admitted into most
of the European catalogues&mdash;the solitary European
species representing it being referred to the genus
<i>Sphinx</i>, <span class="locked">Linn.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></span>&mdash;its separation from <i>Sphinx</i>
appears to me to be justified, not because of the
striking differences presented by the moths, but
because the caterpillars, judging from the little
we know of them, likewise show a similar degree
of difference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
I have frequently succeeded in obtaining fertile
eggs of <i>Anceryx Pinastri</i> and I will now give the
developmental history of this caterpillar, which has
already been figured with great accuracy in Ratzeburg’s
excellent work on forest insects. Rösel
was acquainted with the fact that the “pine moth”
laid its eggs singly on the needles of the pine in
June and July, and he described them as “yellowish,
shining, oval, and of the size of a millet seed.”</p>

<p>On emerging, the caterpillars are six millimeters
in length, of a light yellow colour, the head shining
black with a yellow clypeus. The caudal horn,
which is forked at the tip, is also at first yellowish,
but soon becomes black. No particular marking
is as yet present, but a reddish stripe extends
along the region of the dorsal vessel, and the
course of the spiracles is also marked by an orange-red
line. (Fig. 53, A &amp; B, <a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI</a>.)</p>

<p>As soon as the young larvæ are filled with food
they acquire a greenish streak. The first moult
occurs after four days, and immediately after this
there is still an absence of distinct markings, with
the exception of a greenish-white spiracular line.
In the course of some hours, however, the original
light green ground-colour becomes darker, and at
the same time a sharp, greenish-white subdorsal
line appears, together with a parallel line extending
above the spiracles, which, in <i>Pterogon Gorgoniades</i>,
has already been designated as the
“supra-spiracular.” The dorsal line is absent:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
the head is light green, with two narrow blackish-brown
lines surrounding the clypeus; the horn
and thoracic legs are black; claspers, reddish
green; length, twelve to thirteen millimeters.
(<a href="#Plate_VI">Fig. 54</a>.)</p>

<p class="h7"><i>Third Stage.</i></p>

<p>After another period of four days the second
moult occurs, neither colour nor marking being
thereby affected. Only the horn, now no longer
forked, becomes brownish with a black tip. The
young caterpillars are now, as before, admirably
adapted to the pine needles, on which they feed
by day, and from which they can only be distinguished
with difficulty.</p>

<p class="h7"><i>Fourth Stage.</i></p>

<p>The third moult also brings no essential change.
The ground-colour and marking remain the same,
only the spiracles, which were formerly dull yellowish,
are now of a vivid brick-red. The horn becomes
yellowish-red at the base.</p>

<p class="h7"><i>Fifth Stage.</i></p>

<p>The marking is only completely changed in the
fifth and last stage. A broad reddish-brown dorsal
line replaces the subdorsal, more or less completely.
The supra-spiracular line also becomes broken up
into numerous short lengths, whilst the green
ground-colour in some specimens becomes more or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
less replaced by a brownish shade extending from
the back to the sides. Horn, black; the upper
part of the first segment with a corneous plate,
similar to that of the <i>Deilephila</i> larvæ.</p>

<p>This stage is very variable, as shown by the
figures in various works. The variations arise on
the one hand from the struggle between the green
ground-colour and the reddish-brown extending
from above, and, on the other hand, from a more
or less complete disappearance of the associated
longitudinal lines. The latter are sometimes completely
retained, this being the case in a caterpillar
figured by Hübner (<i>Sphinges</i>, III., <i>Legitimæ</i> C, b),
where both the subdorsal and supra-spiracular lines
are continuous from segment 11 to segment 1,
an instance which may perhaps be regarded as a
reversion to the primary form.</p>

<p>The entire change of the marking from the
fourth to the fifth stage depends upon the fact that
the young larvæ resemble the <i>needles</i> of the pine,
whilst the adults are adapted to the <i>branches</i>. I
shall return to this later.</p>

<p>The ontogeny of <i>A. Pinastri</i> makes us acquainted
with three different forms of marking:
(1) simple coloration without marking; (2) a
marking composed of three pairs of parallel
longitudinal lines; (3) a complicated marking,
arising from the breaking up of the last and the
addition of a darker dorsal line.</p>

<p>Of the fourteen species placed by Gray in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
genus <i>Anceryx</i>, I find, in addition to the one
described, notices of only two <span class="locked">caterpillars:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>A. Coniferarum</i>,<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> a North American species,
lives on <i>Pinus Palustris</i>, and was figured by Abbot
and Smith. Colour and marking very similar to
<i>A. Pinastri</i>.</p>

<p><i>A. Ello</i>, <span class="locked">Linn.,<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></span> according to the authority of
Mérian, is described by <span class="locked">Clemens<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></span> as dark brown,
“with a white dorsal line, and irregular white spots
on the sides.” It lives on a “species of <i>Psidium</i>
or <i>Guava</i>.”</p>

<p>Most of the species of <i>Anceryx</i> appear to live
on <i>Coniferæ</i>, to which they show a general and
decided adaptation. In the absence of decisive
information, I partly infer this from the names, as
<i>Anceryx Juniperi</i> (Africa). It has long been
known that in our <i>A. Pinastri</i> the mixture of
brown and fir-green, interspersed with conspicuous
irregular light yellowish and white spots, causes
the adult larva to present a very perfect adaptation
to its environment. Of this caterpillar Rösel
states:&mdash;“After eating it remains motionless, and
is then difficult to see, because it is of the same
colour as its food, since its brown dorsal line
has almost the colour of the pine twigs; and who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
is not familiar with the fact that beneath the green
needles there is also much yellow to be found?”</p>

<p>This adaptation to the needles and twigs
obviously explains why this caterpillar in the adult
condition is so far removed from those of the
genus <i>Sphinx</i>, while the moths are so nearly
related that they were only separated as a distinct
genus when we became acquainted with a large
number of species.</p>

<h4 id="P2-1-2">II.<br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Conclusions from Phylogeny.</span></span></h4>

<p>The considerations previously set forth are entirely
based on Fritz Müller’s and Haeckel’s view, that
the development of the individual presents the
ancestral history <i>in nuce</i>, the ontogeny being a
condensed recapitulation of the phylogeny.</p>

<p>Although this law is generally true&mdash;all recent
investigations on development having given it
fresh confirmation&mdash;it must not be forgotten that
this “recapitulation” is not only considerably
abbreviated, but may also be “falsified,” so that
a searching examination into each particular case
is very desirable.</p>

<p>The question thus arises, in the first place, as
to whether the markings of caterpillars, so distinct
at the different stages of growth, are actually
to be regarded as residual markings inherited
from the parent-form; or whether their differences
do not depend upon the fact that the caterpillar,
in the course of growth, is exposed to different
external conditions of life, to which it has adapted
itself by assuming a different guise.</p>

<p>The former is undoubtedly the case. It can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
by no means be denied that the conditions of life
in young caterpillars are <i>sometimes</i> different to
those of the adults. It will, in fact, be shown later
on, that in certain cases the assumption of a new
guise at an advanced age actually depends upon
adaptation to new conditions of life; but as a rule,
the external conditions remain very similar during
the development of the larva, as follows from the
fact that a change of food-plant never takes <span class="locked">place.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></span>
We should therefore rather expect a complete
similarity of marking throughout the entire larval
period, instead of the great differences which we
actually observe.</p>

<p>Different circumstances appear to me to show
that the markings of young larvæ are only exceptionally
due to a new adaptation, but that as a
rule they depend upon heredity. In the first
place, there is the fact that closely allied species,
exposed to precisely similar external conditions, as,
for instance, <i>Chærocampa Elpenor</i> and <i>Porcellus</i>,
possess exactly the same markings when young,
these markings nevertheless appearing at different
stages of growth. Thus, the subdorsal line first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
appears in <i>Elpenor</i> in the second stage, whilst in
<i>Porcellus</i> it is present during the first stage. If
this line were acquired by the young larva for
adapting it at this age to special conditions of life,
it should appear in both species at the same
stage. Since this is not the case, we may conclude
that it is only an inherited character derived
from the adult ancestor of the two species, and
now relegated to the young stages, being (so to
speak), pushed further back in one species than in
the other.</p>

<p>But the strongest, and, as it appears to me, the
most convincing proof of the purely phyletic significance
of the young larval markings, is to be
found in the striking regularity with which these are
developed in a similar manner in all allied species,
howsoever different may be their external conditions
of life. In all the species of the <i>Chærocampa</i>
group (the genera <i>Chærocampa</i> and <i>Deilephila</i>) the
marking&mdash;no matter how different this may be in
later stages&mdash;arises from the simple subdorsal line.
This occurs even in species which live on the most
diverse plants, and in which the markings can be
of no biological importance as long as the larvæ
are so small as to be only visible through a lens,
and where there can be no possible imitation of
leaf-stalks or veins, the leaves and caterpillars
being so very distinct.</p>

<p>Moreover, when in the <i>Macroglossinæ</i> (the
genera <i>Macroglossa</i>, <i>Pterogon</i>, and <i>Thyreus</i>) we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
see precisely the same simple marking (the subdorsal)
line retained throughout all the stages in
two genera, whilst in the <i>Smerinthinæ</i> this line
vanishes at a very early stage, and in the <i>Sphinginæ</i>
is only present in traces, we can give but
one explanation of these facts. We have here a
fragmentary series representing the phyletic development
of the Sphinx-markings, which latter
have arisen from one original plan&mdash;the simple
subdorsal line&mdash;and have then undergone further
development in various directions. As this subsequent
development advanced, the older phyletic
stages would always be relegated to younger ontogenetic
stages, until finally they would be but
feebly represented even in the youngest stage (<i>D.
Euphorbiæ</i>), or else entirely eliminated (most of the
species of the genus <i>Sphinx</i>). I believe that no
other sufficient explanation of these facts can be
adduced. Granting that the correctness of the
above views can no longer be doubted, we may
now take up the certain position that the ontogeny
of larval markings reveals their phylogeny,
more or less completely, according to the number
of phyletic stages omitted, or, in some exceptional
cases, falsified. In other words, the ontogeny of
larval markings is a more or less condensed and
occasionally falsified recapitulation of the phylogeny.</p>

<p>Considering this to be established, we have
next to deal with the uniformity of the developmental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
phenomena, from which we may then
attempt to trace out the inciting causes underlying
this development.</p>

<p>The law, or, perhaps better, the line of direction
followed by the development, is essentially
the <span class="locked">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. The development commences with a state of
simplicity, and advances gradually to one of complexity.</p>

<p>2. New characters first make their appearance
in the last stage of the ontogeny.</p>

<p>3. Such characters then become gradually carried
back to the earlier ontogenetic stages, thus
displacing the older characters, until the latter disappear
completely.</p>

<p>The first of these laws appears almost self-evident.
Whenever we speak of development,
we conceive a progression from the simple to the
complex. This result therefore does nothing but
confirm the observation, that we have actually
here before us a development in the true sense of
the word, and not simply a succession of different
independent conditions.</p>

<p>The two following laws, on the other hand, lay
claim to a greater importance. They are not now
enunciated for the first time, but were deduced
some years ago by Würtemberger<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> from a study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
of the ammonites. In this case also the new
characters predominate in the later periods of life,
and are then transferred back to the younger ontogenetic
stages in the course of phyletic development.
“The change in the character of the shell
in ammonites, first makes itself conspicuous in the
last chamber; but in the succeeding generations
this change continually recedes towards the beginning
of the spiral chambers, until it prevails
throughout the greater part of the convolutions.”</p>

<p>In the same sense must also be conceived the
case which Neumayr and Paul have recently made
known respecting certain forms of <i>Melanopsis</i>
from the West Sclavonian <i>Paludina</i> bed. In <i>M.
Recurrens</i> the last convolutions of the shell are
smooth, this being a new character; the small
upper convolutions, however, are delicately ribbed,
as is also the case with the last convolution of
the immediate progenitor. The embryonic convolutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
again are smooth, and the author believes
(on other grounds) that the more remote progenitor
possessed a smooth shell.</p>

<p>In this case therefore, and in that of the ammonites,
every shell to a certain extent proclaims
the ancestral history of the species; in one and the
same shell we find different phyletic stages brought
into proximity. The markings of caterpillars do
not offer similar facilities; nevertheless I believe
that by their means we are led somewhat further,
and are able to enter more deeply into the causes
underlying the processes of transformation, because
we can here observe the living creature, and
are thus enabled to study its life-history with more
precision than is possible with a fossil species.</p>

<p>When, in 1873, I received Würtemberger’s
memoir, I was not only struck with the agreement
of his chief results with those which I
had arrived at by the study of larval markings,
but I was almost as much astonished at the great
difference in the interpretation of the facts. The
latter indicate the gradual backward transference
of a new character from the latest to the earlier
ontogenetic stages. Without further confirmation
Würtemberger assumes that it is to a certain
extent self-evident that the force producing this
backward transference is the same as that which,
according to his view, first called forth the character
in question in the last stage, viz., natural selection.
“Variations acquired at an advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
age of the organism may, when advantageous, be
inherited by the succeeding generations, in such
a manner that they always appear a little earlier
than in the preceding generations.”</p>

<p>It is certainly theoretically conceivable that a
newly acquired character, when also advantageous
to the earlier stages, might be gradually transferred
to these stages, since in this case those individuals
in which this character appeared earliest would
have the greatest chance of surviving. In the
case of the development of larval markings, however,
there are facts which appear to me to show
that such backward transference of a new character
is, in a certain measure, independent of the principle
of utility, and that it must therefore be referred
to another cause&mdash;to the innate law of
growth which rules every organism.</p>

<p>When, in the larva of <i>C. Elpenor</i>, we perceive
that the two eye-spots which are first formed on
the fourth and fifth segments appear subsequently
on the other segments as faint traces of no biological
value whatever, we cannot explain this
phenomenon by natural selection. We should
rather say that in segmented animals there is a
tendency for similar characters to be repeated on
all the segments; and this simply amounts to
the statement, that an innate law of growth is
necessary for the repetition of such newly acquired
characters.</p>

<p>The existence of such a law of growth, acting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
independently of natural selection, may therefore
be considered as established, and indeed cannot be
disputed (Darwin’s “correlation of growth”). In
the present case it appears to me that an innate
law of this kind, determining the backward transference
of new characters, is deducible from the
instances already quoted in another sense, viz.,
from the fact that in many cases characters which
are decidedly advantageous to the adult are transferred
to the younger stages, where they are at most
of but indifferent value, and can certainly be of no
direct advantage. This is the case with the
oblique stripes of <i>Smerinthus</i>, which, in the adult
larvæ, resemble the leaf ribs, as will be shown
more fully later on, and, in conjunction with the
green coloration, cause these caterpillars to be very
difficult of detection on their food-plants. The
insects are easily overlooked, and can only be distinctly
recognized on close inspection.</p>

<p>Now these oblique stripes appear, in all the <i>Smerinthus</i>
caterpillars known to me, in the second, and
sometimes even in the first stage, <i>i.e.</i> in larvæ of
from 0.7 to 1 centimeter in length. The stripes are
here much closer together than the ribs of any of
the leaves of either willow, poplar, or lime, and can
therefore have no resemblance to these leaves.
The young caterpillars are certainly not rendered
more conspicuous by the oblique stripes, since they
can only be recognized on close inspection. It is
for this reason that the stripes have not been
eliminated by natural selection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
The remarkable phenomenon of the backward
transference of newly acquired characters may
therefore be formulated as follows:&mdash;Changes
which have arisen in the later ontogenetic stages
have a tendency to be transferred back to the
younger stages in the course of phyletic development.</p>

<p>The facts of development already recorded
furnish numerous proofs that this transference
occurs gradually, and step by step, taking the
same course as that which led to the first establishment
of the new character in the final ontogenetic
stage.</p>

<p>Did this law not obtain, the ontogeny would
lose much of the interest which it now possesses
for us. It would then be no longer possible,
from the ontogenetic course of development of an
organ or of a character, to draw a conclusion as to
its phylogeny. If, for instance, the eye-spots of
the <i>Chærocampa</i> larvæ, which must have been
acquired at a late age, were transferred back to
the younger ontogenetic stages in the course of
phyletic development, as eye-spots already perfected,
and not showing their rudimentary commencement
as indentations of the subdorsal line,
the phenomenon would then give us no information
as to the manner of their formation.</p>

<p>It is well known to all who have studied the
developmental history of any group of animals,
that no organ, or no character, however complex,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
appears suddenly in the ontogeny; whereas, on
the other hand, it appears certain that new, or
more advanced, but simpler characters, predominate
in the last stage of development. We are
thus led to the following modification of the foregoing
conclusion:&mdash;Newly acquired characters
undergo, as a whole, backward transference, by
which means they are to a certain extent displaced
from the final ontogenetic stage by characters
which appear later.</p>

<p>This must be a purely mechanical process, depending
on that innate law of growth, the action
of which we may observe without being able to
explain fully. Under certain conditions the operation
of this law may be prevented by natural
selection. Thus, for instance, if the young caterpillars
of <i>Anceryx Pinastri</i> have not acquired the
characteristic marking of the adults, it is probably
because they are better protected by their resemblance
to the green pine-needles than they
would be if they possessed the pattern of the
larger caterpillars in their last stage.</p>

<p>The backward transference of newly acquired
characters may also possibly be accelerated when
these characters are advantageous to the younger
stages; but this transference takes place quite
independently of any advantage if the characters
are of indifferent value, being then entirely brought
about by innate laws of growth.</p>

<p>That new characters actually predominate in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
the last stage of the ontogeny, may also be demonstrated
from the markings of caterpillars. It
is, of course, not hereby implied, that throughout
the whole animal kingdom new characters can
only appear in the last ontogenetic stage. Haeckel
is quite correct in maintaining that the power of
adaptation of an organism is not restricted to any
particular period. Under certain circumstances
transformations may occur at any period of development;
and it is precisely insects undergoing
metamorphosis that prove this point, since their
larvæ differ so widely from their imagines that
the earlier stages may be completely disguised.
It is here only signified that, with respect to the
development of caterpillars, new characters first
appear in the adult. The complexity of the markings,
which so frequently increases with the age
of the caterpillar, can scarcely bear any other
interpretation than that the new characters were
always acquired in the last stage of the ontogeny.
In certain cases we are able, although with some
uncertainty, to catch Nature in the act of adding
a new character.</p>

<p>I am disposed to regard the blood-red or rust-red
spots which occur in the last stage of the three
species of <i>Smerinthus</i> larvæ in the neighbourhood
of the oblique stripes as a case in point. It has
already been shown that these red spots must be
regarded as the first rudiments of the linear coloured
edges which reach complete development in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
genus <i>Sphinx</i>. In some specimens of <i>Smerinthus
Tiliæ</i> the spots coalesce so as to form an irregular
coloured edge to the oblique stripes. In <i>S. Populi</i>
they occur in many individuals, but remain always
in the spot stage; whilst <i>S. Ocellatus</i> is but seldom,
and <i>S. Quercus</i> appears never to be spotted.</p>

<p>The spots both of <i>S. Tiliæ</i> and <i>Populi</i> certainly
do not show themselves exclusively in the fifth
(last) stage, but also in the fourth, and sometimes
in <i>Populi</i> even as early as the third stage, from
which we might be disposed to conclude that the
new character did not first appear in the last stage.
But the majority of the spotted individuals first
acquire their spots in the fifth stage, and only a
minority in the fourth; so that their occasional
earlier appearance must be ascribed to the backward
transference of a character acquired in the
fifth stage. Moreover, the fourth and fifth stages
of the caterpillars are closely analogous both in size,
mode of life, and marking, and are therefore analogous
with reference to the environment, so that it
is to be expected that new characters, when depending
on adaptation, would be rapidly transferred
from the fifth stage to the <span class="locked">fourth.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></span> We should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>thus have a case of the acceleration by natural selection,
of processes determined by innate causes.
Why changes should predominate in the last
stage, is a question closely connected with that of
the causes of larval markings in general, and may
therefore be investigated later.

But if we here assume in anticipation that all
new markings depend on adaptation to the conditions
of life, and arise through natural selection,
it will not be difficult to draw the conclusion that
such new characters must prevail in the last stage.
There are two conditions favouring this view;
the size of the insect, and the longer duration of
the last stage. As long as the caterpillar is so
small as to be entirely covered by a leaf, it only
requires a good adaptation in colour in order to be
completely hidden; independently of which, it is
also possible that many of its foes do not consider
it worth attacking at this stage. The last stage,
moreover, is of considerably longer duration than
any of the four preceding ones; in <i>Deilephila
Euphorbiæ</i> this stage lasts for ten days, whilst
the remaining stages have a duration of four days;
in <i>Sphinx Ligustri</i> the last stage also extends
over ten days, and the others over six days.</p>

<p>In its last stage, therefore, a caterpillar is for
a longer period exposed to the danger of being
discovered by its foes; and since, at the same
time, its enemies become more numerous, and its
increased size makes it more easy of detection, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
is readily conceivable that a change in the conditions
of life, such, for instance, as removal to a
new food-plant, would bring about the adaptation
of the <i>adult larva</i> as its chief result.</p>

<p>I shall next proceed to show how far the assumption
here made&mdash;that all markings depend
on natural selection&mdash;is correct.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h4 id="P2-1-3">III.<br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Biological Value of Marking in General.</span></span></h4>

<p>Having now described the development of larval
markings, so far as possible from their external
phenomena, and having traced therefrom the
underlying law of development, I may next proceed
to the main problem&mdash;the attempt to discover
those deeper inciting causes which have produced
marking in general.</p>

<p>The same two contingencies here present
themselves as those which relate to organic life as
a whole; either the remarkably complex and apparently
incomprehensible characters to which we
give the name of markings owe their origin to
the direct and indirect gradual action of the changing
conditions of life, or else they arise from
causes entirely innate in the organism itself, <i>i.e.</i>
from a phyletic vital force. I have already stated
in the Introduction why the markings of caterpillars
appear to me such particularly favourable
characters for deciding this question, or, more
precisely, why these characters, above any others,
appear to me to render such decision more easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
possible; repetition is here therefore unnecessary.</p>

<p>The whole of the present investigation had
not been planned when I joined with those who,
from the first, admitted the omnipotence of natural
selection as an article of faith or scientific
axiom. A question which can only be solved by
the inductive method cannot possibly be regarded
as settled, nor can further evidence be considered
unnecessary, because the first proofs favour the
principle. The admission of a mysteriously working
phyletic power appears very unsatisfactory
to those who are striving after knowledge; the
existence of this power, however, is not to be
considered as disproved, because hundreds of
characters can be referred to the action of natural
selection, and many others to that of the direct
action of the conditions of life. If the development
of the organic world is to be considered as
absolutely dependent on the influence of the environment,
not only should we be able here and
there to select at pleasure characters which appeared
the most accessible for elucidating this
point, but it becomes in the first place necessary
to attempt to completely refer <i>all</i> characters belonging
to any particular group of phenomena,
however small this group might be, to known
transforming factors. We should then see whether
this were possible, or whether there would remain
residual phenomena not explicable by known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
principles and compelling us to admit the existence
of a force of development innate in the
organism. In any case the “phyletic vital force”
can only be got rid of by a process of elimination&mdash;by
proving that all the characters generally occurring
throughout the group of phenomena in
question, must be attributed to other causes, and
that consequently nothing remains for the action
of the supposed phyletic vital force, which
would in this manner be negatived, since we
cannot infer the presence of a force if the latter
exerts no action whatever.</p>

<p>I shall here attempt such an investigation of the
group of phenomena displayed by larval markings,
with special reference to those of the <i>Sphingidæ</i>.
The alternatives upon which we have to decide
are the following:&mdash;Are the markings of caterpillars
purely morphological characters, produced
entirely by internal causes? or, are they simply
the response of the organism to external influences?</p>

<p>The solution of these questions will be arrived at
by seeking to refer all the markings present to
one of the known transforming factors, and the
success or failure of this attempt will give the required
decision. The first question to be attacked
is obviously this,&mdash;whether the Sphinx-markings
are actually, as they appear at first sight,
purely morphological characters. If it can be
shown that all these markings were originally of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
biological value, they must be attributed to the
action of natural selection.</p>

<p>Did I here at once proceed to establish the
biological value of larval markings&mdash;and especially
of those of the <i>Sphingidæ</i>&mdash;so as to arrive in this
manner at a conclusion as to their dependence upon
natural selection, it would be impossible to avoid the
consideration of the total coloration of the caterpillars,
since the marking frequently consists only
of a local strengthening of the colour, and cannot
be comprehended without coming to this understanding.
The action of the markings also often
appears to be opposed to that of the colouring,
making the caterpillar again conspicuous; so that
the two factors must necessarily be considered together.
I shall therefore commence the investigation
with colour in general, and then proceed to
treat of marking.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h4 id="P2-1-4">IV.<br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Biological Value of Colour.</span></span></h4>

<p>The general prevalence of protective colouring
among caterpillars has already been so frequently
treated of that it is not here my intention to
recall particular instances. In order to judge of
the effect of marking, however, it will be well to
bear in mind that these insects, being generally
defenceless and thus requiring protection, have
acquired the most diverse means of rendering
themselves in some measure secure from their
foes.</p>

<p>The sharp spines which occur on the caterpillars
of many butterflies (<i>Vanessa</i>, <i>Melitæa</i>,
<i>Argynnis</i>), and the hairs on those of many moths,
serve for protective purposes. Among other
means of protection&mdash;although in a different sense&mdash;we
have in all the species of the great family of
the <i>Papilionidæ</i> the strikingly coloured (yellowish
red) odour-emitting tentacles concealed near the
head, and suddenly protruded for terrifying foes;
and likewise the forked horn at the tail of the
caterpillars of the genus of moths <i>Harpyia</i>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
tentacles of which can be suddenly protruded in
a similar manner. Adaptive colours and forms
combined with certain <span class="locked">habits<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></span> are, however, much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
more common than defensive weapons. Thus,
the caterpillars of the <i>Noctuæ</i> belonging to the
genus <i>Catocala</i> and its allies, feed only at night on
the green leaves of various forest-trees; by day
they rest in crevices of the bark on the tree trunk,
which they resemble so perfectly in the colour of
their peculiar glossy dull grey or brownish skin
beset with small humps, that only sharp eyes can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
detect them, even when we are familiar with their
<span class="locked">habits.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></span></p>

<p>The striking resemblance of many moths to
splinters of wood is well known, and to this is
added a habit which helps their disguise, viz., that
of remaining stiff and motionless on the approach
of danger, just like a splinter projecting from the
<span class="locked">branch.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></span> Among the moths coming under this
category may be mentioned <i>Cucullia Verbasci</i>, and
particularly those of the genus <i>Xylina</i>, which, when
at rest, closely resemble a broken splinter of wood
in the colour and marking of their fore wings, and
when touched, have a habit of drawing in their
legs and falling without opening their wings as
though dead.</p>

<p>That simple adaptive colouring prevails widely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
among caterpillars is shown by the large number
of green <span class="locked">species.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></span> It may be fairly said that all
caterpillars which possess no other means of protection
or defence are adaptively coloured. These
facts are now well known; so also is the explanation
of the varied and striking colours of many
caterpillars given by <span class="locked">Wallace.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></span> There is, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
novelty in the proof contained in the foregoing
descriptions of larval development, as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
the manner in which the di- and polymorphism
of caterpillars can be explained from the external
phenomena which they present, these phenomena
being well adapted for showing the great importance
of protective colouring to the larvæ. We
have here presented a double adaptation, although
not quite of the nature of that which I formerly
admitted on hypothetical <span class="locked">grounds.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></span> In the first
place, from the developmental history there results
the conclusion that all Sphinx-larvæ which, in the
adult state, are di- or polymorphic, are unicolorous
when young. Thus, the caterpillars of <i>Chærocampa
Elpenor</i> all remain green till the fourth
stage, when they mostly become light or dark
brown, and only very seldom retain their green
colour. <i>Chærocampa Porcellus</i> behaves in a
precisely similar manner; as also does <i>Pterogon
Œnotheræ</i>, which inhabits the same localities, and
is found on the same food-plant, but is not very
closely related to the <i>Chærocampa</i>. In this
species also (<i>P. Œnotheræ</i>) the brown is more
common than the green form in the adult state,
both varieties showing a complicated marking.
The young larvæ possess only a light green
colour, and a pure white subdorsal line as the only
marking; they are so well adapted to the leaves
of their food-plants, <i>Epilobium Hirsutum</i>, and <i>E.
Rosmarinifolium</i>, that they can only be detected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
with great difficulty. After the third moult they
become brown, and can be easily seen when at
rest on their food-plant.</p>

<p>Now in all known caterpillars brown colours are
adaptive, sometimes causing a resemblance to the
soil, and at others to dead leaves or branches. As
soon, therefore, as the caterpillars have attained
a considerable size, they remain concealed by <span class="locked">day.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></span>
The truth of this observation not only appears
from various entomological notes, but I have
frequently convinced myself of its accuracy. I
well remember from the earliest times that <i>C.
Elpenor</i>, especially when the larva is adult, always
rests by day among the dead branches and leaves
of its shrub-like food-plant, <i>Epilobium Hirsutum</i>;
and even when this species lives on the low-growing
<i>Epilobium Parviflorum</i>, it conceals itself by day
on the ground, among the tangled leaves and
branches. I have observed that <i>Sphinx Convolvuli</i>
has a precisely similar habit, for which
reason it is difficult to obtain, even in localities
where it occurs very commonly.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Basle I once found at
mid-day a brown caterpillar of <i>Pterogon Œnotheræ</i>
on an isolated dead branch of <i>Epilobium Rosmarinifolium</i>,
and I was informed by Herr Riggenbach-Stähelin&mdash;a collector
of great experience who
accompanied me&mdash;that these caterpillars always
rest (by day) on withered plants as soon as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
become brown, but before this change they are
only to be found on green plants.</p>

<p>Thus, it cannot well be doubted that the change
of colour is associated with a change in the habits
of life, and the question arises as to which has been
the primary change.</p>

<p>If the view here entertained, that the later
brown coloration is adaptive, be correct, the species
must have first acquired the habit of concealing
itself by day on the ground and among dead
herbage, before the original green colour could
have been changed into brown by natural selection.
This must represent the actual facts of the
case.</p>

<p>Nearly allied species which at an advanced age
are not dimorphic, but are darkly coloured in all
individuals, are especially calculated to throw some
light on this point. For instance, the caterpillar
of <i>Deilephila Vespertilio</i>, which comes under this
denomination, is light green when young, and rests
both by day and night on the leaves of the plant
on which it feeds. As soon as it acquires its dark
colour&mdash;after the third moult&mdash;it changes its habits,
concealing itself by day on the ground and feeding
only by night. For this reason collectors prefer
seeking for it in the evening, or with a lantern by
night.</p>

<p>The most instructive case, however, is that of
<i>Deilephila Hippophaës</i>, in which no change of
colour is associated with age, the caterpillar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
throughout its whole life, remaining of a greyish
green, which exactly matches the colour of the
leaves of its food-plant, <i>Hippophae Rhamnoides</i>.
Nevertheless this species also possesses the habit
of feeding only at night as soon as it has attained
to a considerable size, hiding itself by day at the
root of its food-plant. Collectors expressly state
that this larva can scarcely be found by day, and
recommend that it should be sought for at night
with a lantern.</p>

<p>From the foregoing facts and considerations it
may fairly be concluded, that the habit of hiding
by day, possessed by these and other allied caterpillars,
was acquired when they resembled the
leaves in colour, and that the adaptation to the
colour of the soil, or dead foliage and withered
branches, ensued as a secondary consequence.</p>

<p>But why have these caterpillars acquired such a
habit, since they appear to be perfectly protected
by their resemblance in colour to the green leaves?
The answer to this question is easily given when
we consider in which species this habit generally
occurs.</p>

<p>Does the habit prevail only among the species
of the one genus <i>Deilephila</i>, and in all the species
of this genus? This is by no means the case,
since, on the one hand, many species of <i>Deilephila</i>,
such as <i>D. Euphorbiæ</i>, <i>Galii</i>, <i>Nicæa</i>, and <i>Dahlii</i>,
do not possess the habit, and, on the other hand, it
occurs in species of other genera, such as <i>Macroglossa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
Stellatarum</i>, <i>Sphinx Convolvuli</i>, and <i>Acherontia
Atropos</i>.</p>

<p>The habit in question must therefore be the
result of certain external conditions of life common
to all those species which rest by day. The mode
of life common to them all is that they do not live
on trees with large leaves or with thick foliage,
but on low plants or small-leaved shrubs, such as
the Sea <span class="locked">Buckthorn.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></span> I believe I do not err when
I attribute the habit possessed by the adult larvæ,
of concealing themselves by day, to the fact that
the green colour is protective only so long as they
are small&mdash;or, more precisely speaking, as long as
their size does not considerably exceed that of a
leaf or twig of their food-plant. When they
become considerably larger, they must become
conspicuous in spite of their adaptive colour, so
that it would then be advantageous for them to
conceal themselves by day, and to feed only by
night. This habit they have acquired, and still
observe, even when the secondary adaptation to
the colour of the soil, &amp;c., has not been brought
about. We learn this from <i>D. Hippophaës</i>, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
remains green throughout its whole larval existence;
and no less from the green forms of the adult
larvæ of <i>Sphinx Convolvuli</i>, <i>Chærocampa Elpenor</i>,
and <i>Porcellus</i>, all of which conceal themselves by
day in the same manner as their brown allies.</p>

<p>It may be objected that there are Sphinx-larvæ&mdash;instances
of which I have myself adduced&mdash;which
live on low small-leaved plants, and which
nevertheless do not hide themselves by day. This
is the case with the spurge-feeding <i>D. Euphorbiæ</i>,
so common in many parts of Germany. This
caterpillar must, however, be classed with those
which, on account of their distastefulness, or for
other reasons to be subsequently considered, are
rejected by birds and other larger foes, and which,
as Wallace has shown, derive advantage from
being coloured as vividly as possible. I shall
return to this subject later, when treating of the
biological value of special markings.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is readily conceivable that,
from the conditions of life of caterpillars living on
trees or shrubs with dense foliage, the habit of
resting by day and descending from the tree for
concealment would not have been acquired. Such
larvæ are sufficiently protected by their green
colour among the large and numerous leaves; and
I shall have occasion to show subsequently that
their markings increase this protective resemblance.</p>

<p>The di- or polymorphism of the larvæ of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
<i>Sphingidæ</i> does not therefore depend upon a <i>contemporaneous</i>
double adaptation, but upon the
replacement of an old protective colour by a new
and better one, and therefore upon a <i>successive</i>
double adaptation. The adult caterpillars of <i>C.
Elpenor</i> are not sometimes brown and sometimes
green because some individuals have become
adapted to leaves and others to the soil, but because
the anciently inherited green has not yet been
completely replaced by the newly acquired brown
coloration, some individuals still retaining the old
green colour.</p>

<p>When, in another <span class="locked">place,<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></span> I formerly stated
“that a species can become adapted in this or that
manner to given conditions of life, and that by no
means can only one best adapted form be allowed
for each species,” this statement is theoretically
correct speaking generally, but not in its application
to the present class of cases. A comparison
with one another of those caterpillars which repose
by day, distinctly shows that they all possess a
tendency to abandon the green and assume a dull
colour, but that this process of replacement has
advanced further in some species than in others.
It will not be without interest to follow this
operation in some detailed cases, since we may
thus obtain an insight into the processes by which
polymorphism has arisen, as well as into the connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
between this phenomenon and simple
variability.</p>

<p>In <i>D. Hippophaës</i> the process has either not yet
commenced, or is as yet in its first rudiments. If
we may trust the statements of authors, together
with the ordinary green form there occurs, rarely,
a silver-grey variety, which may be regarded as the
beginning of a process of colour substitution.
Among thirty-five living specimens of this scarce
species which I was able to procure, the grey
form did not occur, neither have I found it in
collections.</p>

<p>In <i>Macroglossa Stellatarum</i> we see the transforming
process in full operation. A large number
of individuals (about thirty-five per cent.) are still
green; the number of dark-coloured individuals
reaches forty-six per cent., these, therefore,
preponderating; whilst between the two extremes
there are about nineteen per cent. of transition
forms, showing all possible shades between light
green and dark blackish-brown or brownish-violet,
and even, in solitary individuals, pure violet
(See Figs. 3&ndash;12, <a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III</a>.). The relatively small
number of the intermediate forms, taken in connection
with the fact that all the 140 specimens
employed in my investigation were obtained from
one female, leads to the conclusion that these
forms owe their existence to cross-breeding. It
would be superfluous to attempt to prove this last
conclusion with reference to the before-mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
case, in which a caterpillar was streaked with brown
and green (Fig. 9, <a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III</a>.).</p>

<p>The process of transformation, as already
mentioned, advances in such a manner that the
intermediate forms diminish relatively to the dark
individuals. This is found to be the case with
<i>Sphinx Convolvuli</i>, and almost to the same extent
with <i>Chærocampa Elpenor</i>, in both of which species
the green caterpillars are the <span class="locked">rarest.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></span> Forms truly
intermediate in colour between green and brown
no longer occur, but apparently only different
shades of light and dark brown, passing into
brownish-black.</p>

<p>The process has again made a further advance
in <i>Chærocampa Porcellus</i> and <i>Celerio</i> as well as in
<i>Pterogon Œnotheræ</i>. In all these species the
green form <span class="locked">occurs,<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></span> but so rarely that very few
collectors have seen it. The brown form has
therefore in these cases nearly become the
predominant type, and the solitary green specimens
which occasionally occur, may be regarded as
reversions to an older phyletic stage.</p>

<p><i>Deilephila Livornica</i> appears to have reached a
similar stage, but the caterpillar of this species
has been so imperfectly observed, that it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
difficult to determine, even approximately, the
relative proportion of the brown to the green
individuals. I have only seen one of the latter
in Dr. Staudinger’s collection (Compare Fig. 62,
<a href="#Plate_VII">Pl. VII</a>.).</p>

<p>In <i>Deilephila Vespertilio</i>, <i>Euphorbiæ</i>, <i>Dahlii</i>,
<i>Mauritanica</i>, <i>Nicæa</i>, and <i>Galii</i>, the green form
has completely disappeared. The blackish olive-green
colour shown by many caterpillars of the
two last species, can be considered as a faint
retention of the light green colour which they
formerly possessed, and which they both show at
the present time in their young stages.</p>

<p>Beginning with the appearance of single darker
individuals, we pass on in the first place to a
greater variability of colouring, and from this, by
the greater diminution of the intermediate forms,
to polymorphism; the complete extermination of
these forms ending in dimorphism. The whole
process of transformation has been thus effected:&mdash;As
the new colouring always prevailed over the old,
the latter was at length completely displaced, and
the caterpillars, which were at first simply variable,
became polymorphic and then dimorphic, finally
returning to monomorphism.</p>

<p>We thus see the process of transformation still
going on, and no doubt can arise as to its
inciting causes. When a character can with
certainty be ascribed to adaptation, we can explain
its origin in no other way than by the action of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
natural selection. If, as I believe, it can and has
been shown, not only that caterpillars in general
possess adaptive colours, but that these colours
can change during the lifetime of one and the
same species, in correspondence with external
conditions, we must certainly gain a very high
conception of the power which natural selection
exerts on this group of living <span class="locked">forms.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></span></p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Biological Value of Special Markings.</span></span></h4>

<p>The following questions now present themselves:
Have the markings of caterpillars any
biological value, or are they in a measure only
sports of nature? Can they be considered as
partially or entirely the result of natural selection,
or has this agency had no share in their production?</p>

<p>The problem here offers itself more distinctly
than in any other group of living forms, because
it presents an alternative without a third possibility.
In other words, if it is not possible to
show that larval markings have a distinct biological
significance, there remains only for their explanation
the assumption of a phyletic force, since the
direct action of the environment is insufficient
to account for such regularity of development
throughout a series of forms. The explanation by
sexual selection is excluded <i>ab initio</i>, since we are
here concerned with larvæ, and not with reproductive
<span class="locked">forms.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
The biological significance of marking&mdash;if such
significance it possess&mdash;will be most easily investigated
by examining whether species with similar
markings have any conditions of life in common
which would permit of any possible inference as
to the significance of the markings.</p>

<p>Among the <i>Sphingidæ</i> we find four chief forms
of marking; (1) complete absence of all marking;
(2) longitudinal stripes; either a simple subdorsal
or this together with a spiracular and dorsal line;
(3) oblique stripes; (4) eye-spots and ring-spots,
single, paired, or in complete rows.</p>

<p>Now if we consider in which species these four
kinds of marking are of general occurrence, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
only in the small group of the <i>Sphingidæ</i> but in
the whole order Lepidoptera, we shall arrive at
the following <span class="locked">results:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Complete absence of marking</i>, so common in
the larvæ of other insects, such as the Coleoptera,
is but seldom found among Lepidopterous caterpillars.</p>

<p>To this category belong all the species of <i>Sesiidæ</i>
(the genera <i>Sesia</i>, <i>Trochilia</i>, <i>Sciapteron</i>, <i>Bembecia</i>,
&amp;c.), the larvæ of which, without exception, are of
a whitish or yellowish colour, and live partly in the
wood of trees and shrubs and partly in the shoots
of herbaceous plants. Subterranean larvæ also,
living at the roots of plants, such as <i>Hepialus
Humuli</i> at the roots of hop, and <i>H. Lupulinus</i> at
those of <i>Triticum Repens</i>, possess neither colour
nor marking. These, like the foregoing, are
yellowish-white, evidently because they are deprived
of the influence of <span class="locked">light.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></span> The larvæ of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>certain small moths, such as <i>Tortrix Arbutana</i>
and <i>Pomonana</i>, which live in fruit, and many case-bearing
<i>Tineina</i>, are likewise without marking and
devoid of bright colour, being generally whitish.

Many of the small caterpillars which feed exteriorly
are also&mdash;so far as my experience extends&mdash;without
definite markings, these being among the
most minute, such as the greenish leaf-mining
species of <i>Nepticula</i>. It is among the larger
species that we first meet with longitudinal and
oblique stripes. Eye-spots do not occur in any of
these larvæ, a circumstance of the greatest importance
for the biological significance of this character,
as will be shown subsequently. The small size of
the caterpillars cannot be the sole cause of the
absence of such eye-spots, since in young <i>Smerinthus</i>
caterpillars one centimeter long, the oblique
stripes are beautifully developed, and the larvæ of
many of the smaller moths considerably exceed
this size. The surface of these caterpillars therefore,
<i>i.e.</i>, the field on which markings are displayed,
is not absolutely too small for the development of
such a character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
Besides the larvæ of the Micro-lepidoptera and
of those species living in the dark, there is also a
complete absence of marking in the young stages
of many caterpillars. Thus, all the <i>Sphingidæ</i> of
which I have been able to observe the development,
show no markings immediately after emergence
from the egg; in many they appear very
soon, even before the first moult, and, in other
species, after this period.</p>

<p>2. <i>The second category of markings, longitudinal
stripes</i>, is very widely distributed among the most
diverse families. This character is found among
the larvæ of butterflies, <i>Sphingidæ</i>, <i>Noctuæ</i>, Micro-lepidoptera,
&amp;c., but in all these groups it is absent
in many species. This last fact is opposed to the
view that this character is purely morphological,
and leads to the supposition that it may have a
biological value, being of service for the preservation
of the individual, and therefore of the
species.</p>

<p>I find that such marking is of service, stripes
extending longitudinally along the upper surface
of the caterpillar generally making the latter less
conspicuous. This, of course, does not hold good
under all circumstances, since there are many
species with very striking colours which possess
longitudinal stripes. Let us consider, however, a
case of adaptive colouring, such as a green caterpillar,
which, on this account only, is difficult to
see, since it accords with the colour of the plant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
on which it lives. If it is a small caterpillar, <i>i.e.</i>,
if its length and thickness do not considerably
exceed that of the parts of its food-plant, it
can scarcely be better concealed&mdash;stripes would
hardly confer any special advantage unless the
parts of the plant were also striped. But the case
is quite different if the caterpillar is considerably
larger than the parts of the plant (leaves, stalks,
&amp;c.). The most perfect adaptive colouring would
not now prevent it from standing out conspicuously
as a larger body, among the surrounding
parts of the plants. It must be distinctly advantageous
therefore to such a caterpillar to be
striped, since these markings to a certain extent
divide the large body into several longitudinal
portions&mdash;they no longer permit it to be seen as
a whole, and thus act more effectively than mere
assimilative colouring in causing it to escape detection.
This protection would be the more efficacious
if the stripes resembled the parts of the plant
in colour and size, such, for instance, as the lines
of light and shadow produced by stalks or by long
and sharp-edged leaves.</p>

<p>If this view be correct, we should expect longitudinal
stripes to be absent in the smallest caterpillars,
and to be present more especially in those
species which live on plants with their parts
similarly disposed, <i>i.e.</i>, on plants with numerous
thin, closely-growing stalks and grass-like leaves,
or on plants with needle-shaped leaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
It has already been mentioned that the smallest
species are devoid of longitudinal striping. The
larvæ of the Micro-lepidoptera show no such
marking, even when they do not live in the dark,
but feed either on the surface or in superficial
galleries of the leaves (<i>Nepticula</i>, &amp;c.), in which
they must be exposed to almost as much light as
when living on the surface. The fact that the
subdorsal line sometimes appears in very young
Sphinx-larvæ is explained, as has already been
shown, by the gradual backward transference of
adaptational characters acquired in the last stage
of development.</p>

<p>It can easily be demonstrated that longitudinally
striped caterpillars mostly live on plants, of which
the general appearance gives the impression of a
striped arrangement. We have only to consider
in connection with their mode of life, any large
group of adaptively coloured species marked in
this manner. Thus, among the butterflies, nearly
all the <i>Satyrinæ</i> possess larvæ conspicuously
striped&mdash;a fact which is readily explicable, because
all these caterpillars live on grasses. This is the
case with the genera <i>Melanargia</i>, <i>Erebia</i>, <i>Satyrus</i>,
<i>Pararge</i>, <i>Epinephele</i>, and <i>Cænonympha</i>, no species
of which, so far as the larvæ are known, is without
longitudinal stripes, and all of which feed on
grasses. It is interesting that here also, as in
certain <i>Sphingidæ</i>, some species are brown, <i>i.e.</i>,
adapted to the soil, whilst the majority are green,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
and are therefore adapted to living grass. Just
as in the case of the <i>Sphingidæ</i> also, the brown
species conceal themselves by day on the earth,
whilst some of the green species have likewise
acquired this habit. I have already shown how
this habit originates from the increasing size of
the growing larva, which would otherwise become
too conspicuous, in spite of adaptive colour and
marking. A beautiful confirmation of this view is
found in the circumstance that only the largest
species of <i>Satyrus</i>, such as <i>S. Proserpinus</i>, <i>Hermione</i>,
<i>Phædrus</i>, &amp;c., possess brown caterpillars.
I should not be surprised if a more exact investigation
of these species, which have hitherto been
but seldom observed, revealed in some cases a
dimorphism similar to that of the <i>Sphingidæ</i>; and
I believe that I may venture to predict that the
young stages of all these brown larvæ&mdash;at present
quite unknown&mdash;are, as in the last-named group,
green.</p>

<p>Besides the <i>Satyrinæ</i>, most of the larvæ of the
<i>Pierinæ</i> and <i>Hesperidæ</i> possess longitudinal stripes,
which are generally less strongly pronounced than
in the former subfamily. Some of the <i>Pierinæ</i>
live on <i>Cruciferæ</i>, of which the narrow leaves and
thin leaf- and flower-stalks present nothing but a
linear arrangement; other species of this group,
however, feed on <i>Leguminosæ</i> (<i>Lathyrus</i>, <i>Lotus</i>,
<i>Coronilla</i>, <i>Vicia</i>), and some few on broad-leaved
bushes (<i>Rhamnus</i>). This last fact may appear to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
opposed to the theory; but light lateral stripes, such
for example, as those possessed by <i>Gonepteryx
Rhamni</i>, can never be disadvantageous, and may
be of use, even on large leaves, so that if we
consider them as an inherited character, there is
no reason for natural selection to eliminate them.
In the case of caterpillars living on vetch, clover,
and other <i>Leguminosæ</i>, it must not be forgotten
that, although their food-plants do not present any
longitudinal arrangement of parts, they always
grow among grasses, the species feeding on such
plants always resting between grass stems, and
very frequently on the grass itself, so that they
can have no better protective marking than
longitudinal stripes. The striping of the <i>Hesperidæ</i>
larvæ, which partly feed on grasses but mostly on
species of <i>Leguminosæ</i>, can be explained in a
similar manner.</p>

<p>It is not here my intention to go through all
the groups of Lepidoptera in this manner. The
instances adduced are quite sufficient to prove
that longitudinal stripes occur wherever we should
expect to find them, and that they really possess
the biological significance which I have ascribed to
them. That these markings are occasionally converted
into an adaptive imitation of certain special
parts of a plant, is shown by the larvæ of many
moths, such for example as <i>Chesias Spartiata</i>,
which lives on broom (<i>Spartium Scoparium</i>),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
its longitudinal stripes deceptively resembling the
sharp edges of the stems of this <span class="locked">plant.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></span></p>

<p>3. <i>Oblique striping.</i> Can the lilac and white
oblique stripes on the sides of a large green
caterpillar, such as those of <i>Sphinx Ligustri</i>; or
the red and white, or white, black, and red stripes
of <i>Smerinthus Tiliæ</i> and <i>Sphinx Drupiferarum</i>
respectively, be of any possible use? Have we
not here just one of those cases which clearly
prove that such a character is purely morphological,
and worthless for the preservation of the
individual? Does not Nature occasionally sport
with purposeless forms and colours; or, as it has
often been poetically expressed, does she not here
give play to the wealth of her phantasy?</p>

<p>At first sight this indeed appears to be the
case. We might almost doubt the adaptive
importance of the green ground-colour on finding
coloured stripes added thereto, and thus&mdash;as one
might suppose&mdash;abolishing the beneficial action
of this ground-colour, by making the insect
strikingly conspicuous. But this view would be
decidedly incorrect, since oblique stripes are of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
just the same importance as longitudinal stripes.
The former serve to render the caterpillar difficult
of detection, by making it resemble, as far as
possible, a leaf; they are imitations of the leaf-veins.</p>

<p>Nobody who is in the habit of searching for
caterpillars will doubt that, in cases where the
oblique stripes are simply white or greenish-white,
it is extremely difficult to see the insect on its
food-plant, <i>e.g.</i> <i>S. Ocellatus</i> on <i>Salix</i>; not only
because it possesses the colour of the leaves, but
no less because its large body does not present
an unbroken green surface, which would bring it
into strong contrast with the leaves, and thus
arrest the attention. In the case of the species
named, the coloured area of the body is divided
by oblique parallel stripes, just in the same
manner as a willow leaf. In such instances of
course we have not presented to us any special
imitation of a leaf with all its details&mdash;there is not
a perfect resemblance of the insect to a leaf, but
only an arrangement of lines and interspaces which
does not greatly differ from the division of a leaf
by its ribs.</p>

<p>That this view is correct is shown by the occurrence
of this form of marking. It is on the whole
rare, being found, besides in many <i>Sphingidæ</i>, in
isolated cases in various families, but is always confined
to those larvæ which live on ribbed leaves, and
never occurring in species which feed on grasses
or on trees with needle-shaped leaves. This has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
already been shown with respect to the <i>Sphingidæ</i>,
in which the oblique stripes are only completely
developed in the subfamilies <i>Smerinthinæ</i> and
<i>Sphinginæ</i>. The species of <i>Smerinthus</i> all live
on trees such as willows, poplars, lime, oak, &amp;c.,
and all possess oblique stripes. The genus
<i>Anceryx</i> also belongs to the <i>Sphinginæ</i>, and these
caterpillars, as far as known, live on trees with
needle-shaped leaves. The moths of this last
genus are very closely allied to the species of
<i>Sphinx</i>, not only in form and colour, but also in
many details of marking. The larvæ are however
different, this distinction arising entirely from
their adaptation to needle-shaped leaves, the
<i>Sphinx</i> caterpillars being adapted to ordinary
foliage. The species of <i>Anceryx</i>, as has been
already shown, are brown mixed with green, and
never possess even a trace of the oblique stripes,
but have a latticed marking, consisting of many
interrupted lines, which very effectively serves to
conceal them among the needles and brown bark
of the <i>Coniferæ</i>.</p>

<p>Of the <i>Sphinginæ</i> living on plants with ordinary
foliage, not a single species is without oblique
stripes. I am acquainted with ten species of
caterpillars and their respective food-plants, viz.
<i>Sphinx Carolina</i>, <i>Convolvuli</i>, <i>Quinquemaculata</i>,
<i>Prini</i>, <i>Drupiferarum</i>, <i>Ligustri</i>; <i>Macrosila Rustica</i>
and <i>Cingulata</i>; <i>Dolba Hylæus</i> and <i>Acherontia
Atropos</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
Besides among the <i>Sphinginæ</i>, oblique stripes
occur in the larvæ of certain butterflies, viz.
<i>Apatura Iris</i>, <i>Ilia</i>, and <i>Clytie</i>, all of which live on
forest trees (aspen and willows), and are excellently
adapted to the leaves by their green colour. In
addition to these, I am acquainted with the larvæ
of some few moths, viz. of <i>Aglia Tau</i> and
<i>Endromis Versicolora</i>, both of which also live on
forest trees.</p>

<p>Oblique stripes also occasionally occur in the
smaller caterpillars of <i>Noctuæ</i>, <i>Geometræ</i>, and
even in those of certain <i>Pyrales</i>, in all of which
they are shorter and differently arranged. In
these cases also, my theory of adaptation holds
good, but it would take us too far if I attempted
to go more closely into them. I will here only
mention the extraordinary adaptation shown by
the caterpillar of <i>Eriopus Pteridis</i>. This little
Noctuid lives on <i>Pteris Aquilina</i>; it possesses
the same green colour as this fern, and has double
oblique white stripes crossing at a sharp angle on
each segment, these resembling the lines of <i>sori</i> of
the fern-frond so closely, that the insect is very
difficult to perceive.</p>

<p>After all these illustrations it can no longer
remain doubtful that the oblique stripes of the
<i>Sphingidæ</i> are adaptive. But how are the
coloured edges bordering these stripes in so many
species to be explained?</p>

<p>I must confess that I long doubted the possibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
of being able to ascribe any biological value
to this character, which appeared to me only
conspicuous, and not protective. Cases may actually
occur in which the brightly coloured edges of the
oblique stripes make the caterpillar conspicuous&mdash;just
in the same manner as any marking may bring
about a conspicuous appearance by presenting a
striking contrast of colour. I am acquainted with
no such instance, however. As a rule, in all well-adapted
caterpillars, considering their colour in
its totality, this is certainly not the case. The
coloured edges, on the contrary, enhance the
deceptive appearance by representing the oblique
shadows cast by the ribs on the under-side of the
leaf; all these caterpillars rest underneath the
leaves, and never on the upper surface.</p>

<p>This explanation may, perhaps, at first sight
appear far-fetched, but if the experiment be made
of observing a caterpillar of <i>Sphinx Ligustri</i> on
its food-plant, not immediately before one’s eyes
in a room, but at a distance as under natural conditions,
it will be found that the violet edges do not
stand out brightly, but show a colour very similar to
that of the shadows playing about the leaves. The
coloured edges, in fact, produce a more effective
breaking up of the large green surface of the
caterpillar’s body, than whitish stripes alone. Of
course if the insect was placed on a bare twig in
the sun, it would be easily visible at a distance; the
larva never rests in such a position, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
but always in the deep shadow of the leaves, in
which situation the coloured edges produce their
peculiar effect. It may be objected that the
oblique white stripes, standing simply on a dark green
ground-colour, would produce the same
effect, and that my explanation therefore leaves
the bright colouring of these edges still unaccounted
for. I certainly cannot say why in <i>Sphinx
Ligustri</i> these edges are lilac, and in <i>S. Drupiferarum</i>,
<i>S. Prini</i>, and <i>Dolba Hylæus</i> red, nor why
they are black and green in <i>Macrosila Rustica</i>, and
blue in <i>Acherontia Atropos</i>. If we knew exactly
on what plants these caterpillars fed originally, we
might perhaps indulge in comparing with an
artistic eye the shadows playing about their
leaves, seeing in one case more red, and in another
more blue or violet. The coloured stripes
of the <i>Sphingidæ</i> must be regarded as the
single strokes of a great master on the countenance
of a human portrait. Looked into closely, we
see red, blue, or even green spots and strokes;
but all these colours, conspicuous when close, disappear
on retreating, a general effect of colour
being then produced, which cannot be precisely
described by words.</p>

<p>Quite in accordance with this explanation, we
see caterpillars with the brightest coloured stripes
concealing themselves in the earth by day, and
betaking themselves to their food-plants only in
the dusk of the evening or dawn of morning and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
even during the night; <i>i.e.</i> in a light so faint that
feeble colours would produce scarcely any effect.
The bright blue of <i>Acherontia Atropos</i>, for example,
would give the impression of oblique shadows
without any distinctive colour.</p>

<p>It is precisely the case of this last caterpillar,
which formerly appeared to me to present insurmountable
difficulties to the explanation of the
coloured stripes by adaptation, and I believed
that this insect would have to be classed with
those species which are brightly coloured because
they are distasteful, and are avoided by birds.
But although we have no experiments on this
point, I must reject this view. Unfortunately, we
know scarcely anything of the ontogeny of this
caterpillar; but we know at least that the young
larvæ (stage four) are greener than the more
purely yellow ones of the fifth stage (which, however,
are also frequently green), and we know
further that some adults are of a dark brownish-grey,
without any striking colours. From analogy
with the dimorphism of the species of <i>Chærocampa</i>
and <i>Sphinx</i>, fully considered previously, it must
therefore be concluded that in this case also, a
new process of adaptation has commenced&mdash;that the
caterpillar is becoming adapted to the soil in and on
which it conceals itself by <span class="locked">day.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></span> An insect which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
acquires undoubted protective colours cannot,
however, be classed with those which possess an
immunity from hostile attacks.</p>

<p>That the coloured edges are correctly explained
as imitations of the oblique shadows of the leaf-ribs,
may also be proved from another point of
view. Let us assume, for the sake of argument,
that these coloured stripes are not adaptive, and
that they have not been produced by natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
selection, but by a hypothetical phyletic force.
We should then expect to see them appear at some
period in the course of the phyletic development&mdash;perhaps
at first only in solitary individuals,
then in several, and finally in all; but we certainly
could not expect that at first single, irregular,
coloured spots should arise in the neighbourhood of
the oblique white stripes&mdash;that these spots should
then multiply, and fusing together, should adhere
to the white stripes, so as to form an irregular
spot-like edge, which finally becomes formed into
a straight, uniformly broad stripe. The phyletic
development of the coloured edges takes place,
however, in such a manner, the species of <i>Smerinthus</i>,
as has already been established, showing
this with particular distinctness. In <i>S. Tiliæ</i> the
course of development can be followed till the
somewhat irregular red border is formed. In the
species of <i>Sphinx</i> this border has become completely
linear. It is very possible that the ontogeny
of <i>S. Ligustri</i> or <i>Drupiferarum</i> would reveal the
whole process, although it may also be possible
that owing to the contraction of the development,
much of the phylogeny is already lost.</p>

<p>I have now arrived at the consideration of the
last kind of marking which occurs in the <i>Sphingidæ</i>,
<span class="locked">viz.:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>4. <i>Eye-spots and Ring-spots.</i>&mdash;These markings,
besides among the <i>Sphingidæ</i>, are found only in a
very few caterpillars, such as certain tropical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
<i>Papilionidæ</i> and <i>Noctuæ</i>. I know nothing of the
conditions of life and habits of these species, however,
and without such knowledge it is impossible
to arrive at a complete explanation.</p>

<p>With Darwin, I take an eye-spot to be “a spot
within a ring of another colour, like the pupil
within the iris,” but to this central spot “concentric
zones” maybe added. In the <i>Chærocampa</i>
larvæ and in <i>Pterogon Œnotheræ</i>, in which complete
ocelli occur, there are always three zones&mdash;a
central spot, the pupil, or, as I have called it,
the “nucleus;” then a light zone, the “mirror;”
and, surrounding this again, a dark zone (generally
black), the “ground-area.”</p>

<p>As ring-spots I will consider those ocelli which
are without the nucleus (pupil), and which are not
therefore, strictly speaking, deceptive imitations
of an eye, but present a conspicuous light spot surrounded
by a dark zone.</p>

<p>Between these two kinds of markings there is,
however, no sharp boundary, and morphologically
they can scarcely be separated. Species with
ring-spots sometimes have nuclei, and ocellated
larvæ in some cases possess only a pale spot instead
of a dark pupil. I deal here with the two kinds
separately, because it happens that they appear in
two distinct genera, in each of which they have
their special developmental history. Ring-spots
originate in a different position, and in another
manner than eye-spots; but it must not, on this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
account, be assumed without further inquiry, that
they are called into existence by the same causes;
they must rather be investigated separately, from
their origin.</p>

<p>Eye-spots are possessed by the genera <i>Chærocampa</i>
and <i>Pterogon</i>; ring-spots by the genus
<i>Deilephila</i>. In accordance with the data furnished
by the above-given developmental histories, the
origination of these markings in the two genera
may be thus <span class="locked">represented:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In the genera named, eye-spots and ring-spots
are formed by the transformation of single portions
of the subdorsal line.</p>

<p>In <i>Chærocampa</i> the primary ocelli originate on
the fourth and fifth segments by the detachment
of a curved portion of the subdorsal, this fragment
becoming the “mirror,” and acquiring a dark
encircling zone (“ground-area”). The nucleus
(pupil) is added subsequently.</p>

<p>In <i>Deilephila</i> we learn from the development of
<i>D. Hippophaës</i>, that the primary annulus arises on
the segment bearing the caudal horn (the eleventh)
by the deposition of a red spot on the white
subdorsal line, which is somewhat enlarged in this
region. The formation of a dark “ground-area”
subsequently occurs, and with this, at first the partial,
and then the complete, detachment of the
mirror-spot from the subdorsal line takes place.</p>

<p>In both genera the spots arise at first locally on
one or two segments, from which they are transferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
to the others as a secondary character. In
<i>Chærocampa</i> this transference is chiefly backwards,
in <i>Deilephila</i> invariably forwards.</p>

<p>We have now to inquire whether complete
eye-spots&mdash;such as those of the <i>Chærocampa</i>
larvæ&mdash;have any significance at all, and whether
they are of biological importance. It is clear at
starting, that these spots do not belong to that
class of markings which make their possessors
more difficult of detection; they have rather the
opposite effect.</p>

<p>We might thus be disposed to class ocellated
caterpillars with those “brightly coloured” species
which, like the <i>Heliconinæ</i> and <i>Danainæ</i> among
butterflies, possess a disgusting taste, and which
to a certain extent bear the signal of their distastefulness
in their brilliant colours. But even if I
had not found by experiment that our native
<i>Chærocampa</i> larvæ were devoured by birds and
lizards, and that they are not therefore distasteful
to these insect persecutors, from the circumstance
that these caterpillars are all protectively coloured,
it could have been inferred that they do not belong
to this category. It has been found that all
adaptively coloured caterpillars are eaten, and one
and the same species cannot possibly be at the
same time inconspicuously (adaptively) and conspicuously
coloured; the one condition excludes
the other.</p>

<p>What other significance can eye-spots possess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
than that of making the insects conspicuous?
Had we to deal with sexually mature forms, we
should, in the first place, think of the action of
sexual selection, and should regard these spots as
objects of taste, like the ocelli on the feathers of
the peacock and argus-pheasant. But we are
here concerned with larvæ, and sexual selection
is thus excluded.</p>

<p>The eye-spots must therefore possess some
other significance, or else they are of no importance
at all to the life of the insect, and are purely
“morphological characters;” in which case, supposing
this could be proved, they would owe their
existence exclusively to forces innate in the organism
itself&mdash;a view which very closely approaches
the admission of a phyletic vital force.</p>

<p>I am of opinion, however, that eye-spots certainly
possess a biological value as a means of terrifying&mdash;they
belong to that numerous class of characters
which occur in the most diverse groups of animals,
and which serve the purpose of making their
possessors appear as alarming as possible.</p>

<p>The caterpillars of the <i>Sphingidæ</i> are known
to behave themselves in different manners when
attacked. Some species, such, for instance, as
<i>Sphinx Ligustri</i> and <i>Smerinthus Ocellatus</i>, on the
approach of danger assume the so-called Sphinx
attitude; if they are then actually seized, they dash
themselves madly to right and left, by this means
not only attempting to get free, but also to terrify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
their persecutor. This habit frequently succeeds
with men, and more especially with women and
children; perhaps more easily in these cases than
with their experienced foes, birds.</p>

<p>The ocellated <i>Chærocampa</i> larvæ behave differently.
They remain quiet on being attacked,
and do not put on a Sphinx-like attitude, but only
withdraw the head and three small front segments
into the large fourth segment, which thus
becomes much swollen, and is on this account
taken for the head of the insect by the <span class="locked">inexperienced.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></span>
Now the large eye-spots are situated
on the fourth segment, and it does not require
much imagination to see in such a caterpillar an
alarming monster with fiery eyes, especially if we
consider the size which it must appear to an enemy
such as a lizard or small bird. <a href="#Plate_IV">Fig. 28</a> represents
the larva of <i>C. Porcellus</i> in an attitude of defence,
although but imperfectly, since the front segments
can be still more withdrawn.</p>

<p>These facts and considerations do not, however,
amount to scientific demonstration, and I therefore
made a series of experiments, in order to determine
whether these caterpillars did actually frighten
small birds. The first experiment proved but little
satisfactory. A jay, which had been domesticated
for years, to which I threw a caterpillar of <i>Chærocampa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
Elpenor</i>, did not give the insect any time
for manœuvring, but killed it immediately by a
strong blow with its bill. This bird had been
tame for years, and was in the habit of pecking at
everything thrown to him. Perhaps a wild jay
(<i>Garrulus Glandarius</i>) would have treated the
insect differently, but it is hardly possible that such
a large and courageous bird would have much
respect for our native caterpillars. I now turned
to wild birds. A large brown <i>Elpenor</i> larva was
placed in the food-trough of an open fowl-house
from which the fowls had been removed. A flock
of sparrows and chaffinches (<i>Fringilla Domestica</i>
and <i>Cœlebs</i>) soon flew down from the neighbouring
trees, and alighted near the trough to pick up
stray food in their usual manner. One bird soon
flew on to the edge of the trough, and was just
about to hop into it when it caught sight of the
caterpillar, and stood jerking its head from side
to side, but did not venture to enter. Another bird
soon came, and behaved in a precisely similar
manner; then a third, and a fourth; others settled
on the perch over the trough, and a flock of ten
or twelve were finally perched around. They all
stretched their heads and looked into the trough,
but none flew into it.</p>

<p>I now made the reverse experiment, by removing
the caterpillar and allowing the birds again
to assemble, when they hopped briskly into the
trough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
I often repeated this experiment, and always
with the same result. Once it could be plainly
seen that it was really fear and not mere curiosity
that the birds showed towards the caterpillar.
The latter was outside the trough amongst
scattered grains of food, so that from one side it
was concealed by the trough. A sparrow flew
down obliquely from above, so that at first it could
not see the caterpillar, close to which it alighted.
The instant it caught sight of the insect, however,
it turned in evident fright and flew away.</p>

<p>Of course these experiments do not prove that
the larger insectivorous birds are also afraid of
these caterpillars. Although I have not been able
to experiment with such birds, I can certainly
prove that even fowls have a strong dislike to
these insects. I frequently placed a large <i>Elpenor</i>
larva in the poultry yard, where it was soon discovered,
and a fowl would run hastily towards it,
but would draw back its head just when about to
give a blow with the bill, as soon as it saw the
caterpillar closely. The bird would now run round
the larva irresolutely in a circle&mdash;the insect in the
meantime assuming its terrifying attitude&mdash;and
stretching out its head would make ten or twenty
attempts to deal a blow with its bill, drawing back
again each time. All the cocks and hens acted in
a similar manner, and it was often five or ten
minutes before one particularly courageous bird
would give the first peck, which would soon be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
followed by a second and third, till the caterpillar,
appearing palatable, would finally be
swallowed.</p>

<p>These experiments were always made in the
presence of several persons, in order to guard
myself against too subjective an interpretation of
the phenomena; but they all invariably considered
the conduct of the birds to be as I have here
represented <span class="locked">it.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></span></p>

<p>If it be admitted that the ocelli of caterpillars
are thus means of exciting terror, the difficulty of
their occurring in protectively coloured species at
once vanishes. They do not diminish the advantage
of the adaptive colouring, because they do not
make the caterpillars conspicuous, or at least any
more easily visible at a distance, excepting when
the insects have assumed their attitude of alarm.
But these markings are of use when, in spite of
protective colouring, the larva is attacked by an
enemy. The eye-spots accordingly serve the
caterpillar as a second means of defence, which
is resorted to when the protective colouring has
failed.</p>

<p>By this it must not be understood that the ocelli
of the <i>Chærocampa</i> larvæ invariably possess only
this, and no other significance for the life of the
insect. Every pattern can be conceived to render<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
its possessor in the highest degree conspicuous by
strongly contrasted and brilliant colouring, so that
it might be anticipated that perfect eye-spots in
certain unpalatable species would lose their original
meaning, and instead of serving for terrifying become
mere signals of distastefulness. This is
perhaps the case with <i>Chærocampa Tersa</i> (<a href="#Plate_IV">Fig. 35</a>),
the numerous eye-spots of which make the insect
easily visible. Without experimenting on this
point, however, no certain conclusion can be
ventured upon, and it may be equally possible that
in this case the variegated ocelli with bright red
nuclei resemble the blossoms of the food-plant
(<i>Spermacoce Hyssopifolia</i>).<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> I here mention this
possibility only in order to show how an inherited
form of marking, even when as well-defined and
complicated as in the present case, may, under certain
circumstances, be turned in quite another
direction by natural selection, for the benefit of its
possessor. Just in the same manner one and the
same organ, such, for instance, as the limb of a
crustacean, may, in the course of phyletic development,
perform very different functions&mdash;first serving
for locomotion, then for respiration, then for
reproduction or oviposition, and finally for the
acquisition of food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
I now proceed to the consideration of the biological
value of incomplete eye-spots, or, as I have
termed them, ring-spots. Are these also means
of terrifying, or are they only signals of distastefulness?</p>

<p>I must at the outset acknowledge that on this
point I am able to offer but a very undecided
explanation. The decision is only to be arrived
at by experiments conducted with each separate
species upon which one desires to pronounce
judgment. It is not here legitimate to draw
analogical inferences, and to apply one case to all,
since it is not only possible, but very probable, that
the biological significance of ring-spots changes in
different species. Nothing but a large series of
experiments could completely establish this. Unfortunately
I have hitherto failed in obtaining
materials for this purpose. I would have deferred
the publication of this essay for a year, could I have
foreseen with certainty that such materials would
have been forthcoming in sufficient quantity during
the following summer; but this unfortunately depends
very much upon chance, and I believed that
a preliminary conclusion would be preferable to
uncertainty. Perhaps some entomologist to whom
materials are more easily accessible, may, by
continuing these experiments, accomplish this
object.</p>

<p>The experiments hitherto made by other observers,
are not sufficient for deciding the question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
under consideration. <span class="locked">Weir,<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></span> as is well known,
showed that certain brightly coloured and conspicuous
larvæ were refused by insectivorous birds;
and <span class="locked">Butler<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></span> proved the same for lizards and frogs.
These experiments are unfortunately so briefly
described, that in no case is the species experimented
with mentioned by name, so that we do
not know whether there were any Sphinx caterpillars
among <span class="locked">them.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></span> I have likewise experimented
in this direction with lizards, in order to convince
myself of the truth of the statement that (1) there
are caterpillars which are not eaten on account of
their taste, and (2) that such larvæ possess bright
colours. I obtained positive, and on the whole,
very decided results. Thus, the common orange
and blue striped caterpillars of <i>Bombyx Neustria</i>
enjoyed complete immunity from the attacks of
lizards, whilst those of the nearly allied <i>Eriogaster
Lanestris</i> and <i>L. Pini</i> were devoured, although not
exactly relished. That the hairiness is not the
cause of their being unpalatable, is shown by the
fact that <i>L. Pini</i> is much more hairy than <i>B.
Neustria</i>. The very conspicuous yellow and black
ringed caterpillar of <i>Euchelia Jacobææ</i> gave also
most decided results. I frequently placed this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
insect in a cage with <i>Lacerta Viridis</i>, but they
would never even notice them, and I often saw the
caterpillars crawl over the body, or even the head
of the lizards, without being snapped at. On every
occasion the larvæ remained for several days with
the lizards without one being ever missed. The
reptiles behaved in a precisely similar manner with
respect to the moth of <i>E. Jacobææ</i>, not one of
which was ever touched by them. The yellow
and black longitudinally striped caterpillars of
<i>Pygæra Bucephala</i> were also avoided, and so were
the brightly coloured larvæ of the large cabbage
white (<i>Pieris Brassicæ</i>), which when crushed give
a disagreeable odour. This last property clearly
shows why lizards reject this species as distasteful.
Both caterpillar and butterfly possess a blood of a
strong yellow colour and oily consistency, in
which, however, I could not detect such a decided
smell as is emitted by that of the <i>Heliconinæ</i> and
<i>Danainæ</i>.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<p>I next made the experiment of placing before
a lizard a caterpillar as much as possible like that
of <i>E. Jacobææ</i>. Half grown larvæ of <i>Bombyx
Rubi</i> likewise possess golden yellow (but narrower)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
transverse rings on a dark ground, and they are
much more hairy than those of <i>E. Jacobææ</i>. The
lizard first applied its tongue to this caterpillar and
then withdrew it, so that I believed it would also
be avoided; nevertheless it was subsequently
eaten. The caterpillars of <i>Saturnia Carpini</i> were
similarly devoured in spite of their bristly hairs,
and likewise cuspidate larvæ (<i>Dicranura Vinula</i>),
notwithstanding their extraordinary appearance and
their forked caudal <span class="locked">horn.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></span> These lizards were by
no means epicures, but consumed large numbers of
earth-worms, slugs, and great caterpillars, and once
a specimen of the large and powerfully biting Orthopteron,
<i>Decticus Verucivorus</i>. Creatures which
possessed a strongly repugnant odour were, however,
always rejected, this being the case with the
strongly smelling beetle, <i>Chrysomela Populi</i>, as also
with the stinking centipede, <i>Iulus Terrestris</i>,
whilst the inodorous <i>Lithobius Forficatus</i> was
greedily eaten. I will call particular attention to
these last facts, because they favour the supposition
that with rejected caterpillars a disgusting odour&mdash;although
perhaps not always perceptible by us&mdash;is
the cause of their being unpalatable.</p>

<p>Striking colours are of course only signals of
distastefulness, and the experiment with <i>Bombyx<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
Rubi</i> shows that the lizards were from the first
prejudiced against such larvæ, the prejudice only
being overcome on actually trying the specimen
offered. A subsequent observation which I made
after arriving at this conclusion, is most noteworthy.
After the lizard had learnt by experience
that there might be not only distasteful caterpillars
(<i>E. Jacobææ</i>), but also palatable ones banded with
black and yellow (<i>B. Rubi</i>), it sometimes tasted
the <i>Jacobææ</i> larvæ, as if to convince itself that the
insect was actually as it appeared to be, viz., unpalatable!</p>

<p>A striking appearance combined with a very
perceptible and penetrating odour is occasionally
to be met with, as in the caterpillar of the common
Swallow-tail, <i>Papilio Machaon</i>. I have never seen
a lizard make the slightest attempt to attack this
species. I once placed two large specimens of
this caterpillar in the lizard vivarium, where they
remained for five days, and finally pupated unharmed
on the side of the case.</p>

<p>I have recorded these experiments, although
they do not thus far relate to Sphinx-caterpillars,
with the markings of which we are here primarily
concerned, because it appeared to me in the first
place necessary to establish by my own experiments
that signals of distastefulness did occur in
caterpillars.</p>

<p>I now come to my unfortunately very meagre
experience with <i>Deilephila</i> larvæ, with only two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
species of which have I been able to experiment,
viz., <i>D. Galii</i> and <i>Euphorbiæ</i>.</p>

<p>The first of these was constantly rejected. Two
large caterpillars, one of the black and the other
of the yellow variety, were left for twelve hours in
the lizard vivarium, without being either examined
or touched. It thus appears that <i>D. Galii</i> is a
distasteful morsel to lizards; and the habits of the
caterpillar are quite in accordance with this, since
it does not conceal itself, but rests fully exposed
by day on a stem, so that it can scarcely escape
being detected. It is almost as conspicuous as
<i>D. Euphorbiæ</i>.</p>

<p>I was much surprised to find, however, that this
last species was not rejected by lizards. On placing
a large caterpillar, six to seven centimeters long,
in the vivarium, the lizard immediately commenced
to watch it, and as soon as it began to crawl
about, seized it by the head, and, after shaking it
violently, commenced to swallow it. In spite of
its vigorous twisting and turning, the insect
gradually began to disappear, amidst repeated
shakings; and in less than five minutes was
completely <span class="locked">swallowed.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></span> With regard to lizards,
therefore, the prominent ring-spots of this larva
are not effective as a means of alarm, nor are they
considered as a sign of distastefulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
Unfortunately I have not hitherto been able to
make any experiments with birds. It would be
rash to conclude from the experience with lizards
that ring-spots were of no biological value. There
is scarcely any one means of protection which
can render its possessor secure against <i>all</i> its foes.
The venom of the most poisonous snakes does
not protect them from the attack of the secretary
bird (<i>Serpentarius Secretarius</i>) and serpent eagle
(<i>Spilornis Cheela</i>); and the adder, as is well known,
is devoured by hedgehogs without hesitation. It
must therefore be admitted that many species
which are protected by distastefulness, may possess
certain foes against which this quality is of no
avail. Thus, it cannot be said that brightly
coloured caterpillars, which are not eaten by birds
and lizards, are also spared by ichneumons. It is
readily conceivable therefore, that the larva of
<i>D. Euphorbiæ</i> may not be unpalatable to lizards,
because they swallow it whole; whilst it is perhaps
distasteful to birds, because they must hack and
tear in order to swallow it.</p>

<p>From these considerations it still appears most
probable to me that <i>D. Euphorbiæ</i>, and the nearly
allied <i>D. Dahlii</i> and <i>Mauritanica</i>, bear conspicuous
ring-spots as signs of their being unpalatable to
the majority of their foes. The fact that these
species feed on poisonous <i>Euphorbiaceæ</i>, combined
with their habit of exposing themselves openly by
day, so as to be easily seen at a distance, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
perhaps give support to this view. As these
insects are not protectively coloured, this habit
would long ago have led to their extermination;
instead of this, however, we find that in all
situations favourable to their conditions of life
they are among the commonest of the <i>Sphingidæ</i>.</p>

<p>Thus, <i>D. Euphorbiæ</i> occurs in large numbers
both in South and North Germany (Berlin); and
Dr. Staudinger informs me that in Sardinia the
larvæ of <i>D. Dahlii</i> were brought to him by
baskets full.</p>

<p>But if the conspicuous ring-spots (combined of
course with the other bright colours) may be
regarded as signals of distastefulness in many
species of <i>Deilephila</i>, this by no means excludes
the possibility that in some species these markings
play another part, and are effective as a means
of alarm. It even appears conceivable to me
that in one and the same caterpillar they may
play both parts against different foes, and it
would certainly be of interest to confirm or refute
this supposition by experiment.</p>

<p>In the light yellow variety of the caterpillar
of <i>D. Galii</i> the ring-spots may serve as means of
alarm, and still more so in that of <i>D. Nicæa</i>, the
resemblance of which to a snake has struck earlier
<span class="locked">observers.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
In those species of <i>Deilephila</i> which conceal
themselves by day, the ring-spots cannot be considered
as signals of distastefulness, and they
must therefore have some other meaning. As
examples of this class may be mentioned <i>D.
Vespertilio</i>, which is protectively coloured both in
the young and in the adult stages; and likewise
<i>D. Hippophaës</i>, in which this habit of concealment
is associated with adaptive colouring. In the
case of the first-named species, it appears possible
that the numerous large ring-spots may serve to
alarm small foes, but the truth of this supposition
could only be decided by experiment. In <i>D. Hippophaës</i>,
on the other hand, such an interpretation
must be at once rejected, since most individuals
possess but a single ring-spot, which shows no
resemblance whatever to an eye.</p>

<p>I long sought in vain for the meaning of this
ring-spot, the discovery of which would in this
particular case be of the greatest value, because
we have here obviously the commencement of the
whole development of ring-spots before us&mdash;the
initial stage from which the marking of all the
other species of <i>Deilephila</i> has proceeded.</p>

<p>I believe that I have now found the correct
answer to this riddle, but unfortunately at a period
of the year when I am unable to prove it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
experimentally. I consider that the ring-spots
are crude imitations of the berries of the food-plant.
The latter are orange-red, and exactly of
the same colour as the spots; the agreement in
colour between the latter and the berries is quite
as close as that between the leaves and the
general colouring of the caterpillar. I know of
no species which more closely resembles the
colour of the leaves of its food-plant, the dark
upper side and light under side corresponding in
the leaves and caterpillars. The colour of the
<i>Hippophae</i> is not an ordinary green, but a grey-green,
which shade also occurs, although certainly
but rarely, in the larvæ. I may expressly state that
I have repeatedly shown to people as many as six
to eight of the large caterpillars on one buckthorn
branch, without their being able at once to detect
them. It is not therefore mere supposition, but a
fact, that this species is protected by its general
colouring. At first the orange-red spots appear
rather to diminish this protection&mdash;at least when
the insects are placed on young shoots bearing no
berries. But since at the same time when the
berries become red (end of July and the beginning
of August) the caterpillars are in their last stage
of development (<i>i.e.</i> possess red spots), it appears
extremely probable that these spots are vague
representations of the berries. For the same
reason that these caterpillars have acquired the
habit of feeding only at dusk and during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
morning twilight, or at night, and of concealing
themselves by day, it must be advantageous for
them to have the surface of their large bodies not
only divided by white stripes, but also interrupted
in yet another manner. How could this be better
effected than by two spots which, in colour and
position, represent the grouping of the red berries
on the branches? When feeding, the insect
always rests with the hind segments on a branch,
the front segments only being more or less raised
and held parallel to the leaves; the red spots thus
always appear on the stem, where the berries are
likewise situated. It might indeed be almost
supposed that the small progress which the
formation of secondary ring-spots on the other
segments has made up to the present time, is
explicable by the fact that such berry-like spots
on other portions of the caterpillar would be rather
injurious than useful.</p>

<p>It may, however, be asked how an imitation of
red berries, which are eaten by birds just as much
as other berries, can be advantageous to a caterpillar,
since by this means it would rather attract
the attention of its enemies?</p>

<p>Two answers can be given to this. In the
first place, the berries are so numerous on every
plant that there is but a very small chance of the
smaller and less conspicuous berry-spots catching
the eye of a bird before the true berries; and,
secondly, the latter, although beginning to turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
red when the caterpillars are feeding, do not
completely ripen till the autumn, when the leaves
are shed, and the yellowish-red clusters of berries
can be seen at a distance. The caterpillar, however,
pupates long before this time.</p>

<p>I have considered this case in such detail because
it appears to me of special importance. It
is the only instance which teaches us that the rows
of ring-spots of the <i>Deilephila</i> larvæ proceed from
one original pair&mdash;the only instance which permits
of the whole course of development being traced
to its origin. Were it possible to arrive at the
causes of the formation of these spots, their
original or primary significance would thereby be
made clear.</p>

<p>I will now briefly summarise the results of the
investigation of the biological value of the <i>Deilephila</i>
ring-spots.</p>

<p>In the known species of the genus now existing
these spots have different meanings.</p>

<p>In some species (certainly in <i>Galii</i>, and probably
in <i>Euphorbiæ</i> and <i>Mauritanica</i>) the conspicuous
ring-spots serve as signals of distastefulness
for certain enemies (not for all).</p>

<p>In a second group of species they serve as a
means of alarm, like the eye-spots of the <i>Chærocampa</i>
larvæ (<i>Nicæa</i>? light form of <i>Galii</i>?).</p>

<p>Finally, in a third group, of which I can at
present only cite <i>Hippophaës</i>, they act as an
adaptive resemblance to a portion of a plant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
and enhance the efficacy of the protective colouring.</p>

<p class="p2">5. <i>Subordinate Markings.</i>&mdash;If, from the foregoing
considerations, it appears that the three chief elements
of the Sphinx-markings&mdash;longitudinal and
oblique stripes, and spot formations&mdash;are not purely
morphological characters, but have a very decided
significance with respect to their possessors, there
should be no difficulty in referring the whole of
the markings of the <i>Sphingidæ</i> to the action of
natural selection, supposing that these three kinds
of marking were the only ones which actually
occurred.</p>

<p>In various species, however, there appear other
patterns, which I have comprised under the term
“subordinate markings,” some of which I will
select, for the purpose of showing the reasons which
permit of their being thus designated.</p>

<p>I ascribe to this category, for example, that fine
network of dark longitudinal streaks which often
extends over the whole upper side of the caterpillar,
and which is termed the “reticulation.”
This character is found chiefly in the adult larvæ
of <i>Chærocampa</i>, being most strongly pronounced
in the brown varieties: it occurs also in <i>Deilephila
Vespertilio</i>, <i>Pterogon Œnotheræ</i>, and <i>Sphinx Convolvuli</i>.
As far as I know, it is only associated
with adaptive colours, and indeed occurs only in
those caterpillars which rest periodically at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
base of their food-plants among the dead leaves
and branches. I do not consider this reticulation
to be a distinct imitation, but only as one of the
various means of breaking up the large uniform
surface of the caterpillar so as to make it present
inequalities, and thus render it less conspicuous.
There can be no doubt as to the dependence of
this character upon natural selection.</p>

<p>There is, however, a second group of markings,
which must be referred to another origin. To
this group, for instance, belong those light dots
in <i>Chærocampa Porcellus</i> and <i>Elpenor</i> which have
been termed “dorsal spots.” I know of no other
explanation for these than that they are the necessary
results of other new formations, and depend
on correlation (Darwin), or, as I may express it,
they are the result of the action of the law governing
the organization of these species.</p>

<p>As long as we are confined to the mere supposition
that the character in question may be
the outward expression of an innate law of growth,
it is permissible to attempt to show that a quite
similar formation in another species depends upon
such a law.</p>

<p>Many of the dark specimens of <i>Sphinx Convolvuli</i>
show whitish dots on segments six to eleven,
one being situated on the front edge of each of
these segments, at the height of the completely
vanished subdorsal line (<a href="#Plate_VI">Fig. 52</a>). These spots
vary much in size, lightness, and sharpness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
definition. Now it might be difficult to attribute
any biological significance to this character, but its
origin becomes clear on examining light specimens
in which the oblique white stripes are distinct on
the sides and the subdorsal line is retained at
least on the five or six anterior segments. It can
then be seen that the spots are located at the
points of intersection of the subdorsal and the
oblique stripes (Fig. 16, <a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III</a>.), and they can
accordingly be explained by the tendency to the
deposition of light pigment being twice as great
in these positions as in other portions of the two
systems of light lines. Light spots are thus
formed when the lines which cross at these points
are partially or completely extinct throughout
their remaining course.</p>

<p>A marking is therefore produced in this case by
a purely innate law of growth&mdash;by the superposition
of two ancient characters now rudimentary.
Many other unimportant details of marking must
be regarded as having been produced in a similar
manner, although it may not be possible to prove
this with respect to every minute spot and stripe.
The majority of “subordinate markings” depend
on the commingling of inherited, but now meaningless,
characters with newly acquired ones.</p>

<p>It would be quite erroneous to attribute to
natural selection only those characters which can
be demonstrated to still possess a biological value
in the species possessing them. They may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
equally due to heredity. Thus, it is quite possible
that the faint and inconspicuous ring-spots of <i>Deilephila
Vespertilio</i> are now valueless to the life of
the species&mdash;they may be derived from an ancestral
form, and have not been eliminated by natural
selection simply because they are harmless. I
only mention this as a hypothetical case.</p>

<p>In the case of markings of the second class,
<i>i.e.</i> oblique stripes, a transference to later phyletic
stages can be demonstrated, although the stripes
thereby lose their original biological value. Thus,
the <i>Chærocampa</i> larvæ, when they were green
throughout their whole life and adapted to the
leaves, appear to have all possessed light oblique
stripes in imitation of the leaf-ribs. All the species
of the older type of colouring and marking, such
as <i>Chærocampa Syriaca</i> (<a href="#Plate_IV">Fig. 29</a>) and <i>Darapsa
Chœrilus</i> (<a href="#Plate_IV">Fig. 34</a>), and also the light green young
forms of <i>C. Elpenor</i> (<a href="#Plate_IV">Fig. 20</a>), and <i>Porcellus</i>
(<a href="#Plate_IV">Figs. 25 and 26</a>), show these oblique stripes. In
these last species the foliage imitation is abandoned
at a later stage, and a dark brown, or blackish-brown,
ground-colour acquired. Nevertheless the
oblique stripes do not disappear, but show themselves&mdash;in
the fourth stage especially, and sometimes
in the fifth&mdash;as distinct dirty yellow stripes, although
not so sharply defined as in the earlier stages.
These persistent stripes, in accordance with their
small biological value, are very variable, since
they are only useful in so far as they help to break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
up the large surface presented by the caterpillar,
and are of no value as imitations of surrounding
objects.</p>

<p>The oblique stripes of <i>Sphinx Convolvuli</i> offer
a precisely similar case; and it may be safely predicted
that the young forms of this species would
possess sharply defined light oblique stripes, since
more or less distinct remnants of these markings
occur in all the adult larvæ, and especially in the
green form. The entire pattern of this caterpillar
depends essentially on the commingling of characters
persisting from an earlier period, <i>i.e.</i> of residues
of the subdorsal and oblique stripes, both these
markings being extraordinarily variable. The
black reticulation was added to the ground-colour
as a new means of adaptation, this character
appearing only in the phyletically younger
brown form, and being entirely absent, or only
faintly indicated, in the older green variety.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h4 id="P2-1-6">VI.<br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Objections to a Phyletic Vital Force.</span></span></h4>

<p>It has been shown in the previous section that the
three elements composing the markings of the
Sphinx-larvæ originally possessed a distinct significance
with respect to the life of the species, and
that they were by this means called into existence.
It has likewise been shown, that in most of the
species which possess these characters at the present
time they still have a decided, although sometimes
a different use, for their possessors, so that
from this point of view no objection can be raised
to their being considered as having arisen by
natural selection.</p>

<p>On looking at the phenomenon as a whole,
however, certain instances occur which appear
quite irreconcilable with this view.</p>

<p>The most formidable objection is offered by the
genus <i>Deilephila</i>. The row of ring-spots which
nearly all the existing species have more or less
developed, has arisen from a simple subdorsal line.
It would not, therefore, be surprising if a species
were discovered which possessed this line without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
any ring-spots as its only marking. If <i>D. Hippophaës</i>
were thus marked, there would be no objection
to the theoretical assumption that <span class="locked">this<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></span> was the
ancestor of the other species. It would then be
said that ring-spots were first developed in a later
species by natural selection, and that they had been
transmitted to all succeeding and younger species.</p>

<p>Certain individuals of <i>D. Hippophaës</i>, however,
possess small ring-spots, some of which are well
developed on several segments. In this species
the row of ring-spots is therefore comprised in the
development. The remaining species, which are
much younger phyletically than <i>Hippophaës</i>, could
not have inherited their ring-spots from the latter,
since this species itself only possesses them occasionally,
and, so to speak, in a tentative manner.
The spots would therefore appear to have arisen
spontaneously in this species, and independently
of those in the other species. But if this were the
case, how should we be able to prove that in the
other species also the ring-spots did not arise
independently; and if, moreover, a large number
of species showed the same character without its
being referable to inheritance from a common
ancestor, how could this be otherwise explained
than as the result of a force innate in these species
and producing similar variations? But this is
nothing but Askenasy’s “fixed direction of variation”&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
a phyletic vital force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
The only escape from this difficulty is perhaps
to be found in proving that <i>D. Hippophaës</i> formerly
possessed ring-spots, and that these have been
subsequently either partially or completely lost, so
that their occasional appearance in this species
would therefore depend upon reversion. The
ontogeny, however, teaches us that this is not the
case, since the young caterpillar does not possess
a greater number of more distinct ring-spots, but
wants them altogether with the exception of a red
spot on the eleventh segment, which is, however,
much fainter than in the last stage.</p>

<p>This last-mentioned fact contains the solution
of the problem. The premises from which this
reasoning set out were all incorrect&mdash;the one red
spot on the eleventh segment is likewise a ring-spot,
and indeed the most important one of all,
being primary, or the first to come into existence.
Now all specimens, without exception, possess this
first ring-spot, which is useful, and has therefore
been called forth by natural selection; it is not
inherited, but newly acquired by this species; at
least, if the explanation of these spots which I
have previously offered is correct.</p>

<p>The primary pair of spots may have been transferred
from this to later species by heredity; and
since, in all segmented animals there is a tendency
for the peculiarities of one segment to be repeated
on the others, this repetition must have occurred
with greater frequency and more completely in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
the later species&mdash;the more so if the process were
favoured by natural selection, <i>i.e.</i> if the row of
ring-spots which originated in this manner could
in any way be turned to the use of the species.</p>

<p>In <i>Hippophaës</i> itself there must also be a tendency
to the formation of secondary ring-spots,
and indeed in a number of specimens we actually
see series of such ring-spots, the latter being present
in varying numbers, and in very different
states of development. The fact that the ring-spots
have not become a constant and well-developed
character, is simply explained by the
circumstance that as such they would have endangered
the existence of the species.</p>

<p>In this case there is therefore no necessity for
assuming a phyletic vital force. The ring-spots
of the genus <i>Deilephila</i> rather furnish us with an
excellent explanation of a fact which might otherwise
have been adduced in support of a phyletic
vital force, viz., the strict uniformity in the development
of larval markings.</p>

<p>Before I had been led to the discovery, by the
study of the marking and development of <i>Hippophaës</i>,
that the spots of the genus <i>Deilephila</i> originated
on one segment only, from which they were
transferred secondarily to the others, this astonishing
regularity appeared to me an incomprehensible
problem, which could only be solved by assuming
a phyletic vital force. If it be attempted, for the
ten species here considered, to construct a genealogical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
tree based on the supposition that it is the
<i>rows of spots</i> which have been inherited in cases
where they occur, and not the <i>mere tendency to
their production</i> by the transference of the one
originally inherited primary spot to the remaining
segments, the attempt will fail. The greater
number of the species would have to be arranged
in one row, since one species always bears a perfected
form of marking, which appears in the young
stages of the following species. But it is very
improbable that nine different species, derived
directly the one from the other, would contemporaneously
<span class="locked">survive.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></span> One species, <i>D. Vespertilio</i>,
could not be inserted at all in the genealogical
tree, since it wants one character which occurs in
all the other species, viz., the caudal horn, which
is absent even in the third stage, and must therefore
have been lost at a very early period of the
phyletic development, so that we may consider it
to be on this account genetically allied to the
oldest known form. But the markings of this
larva pass through precisely the same stages of
development as do those of the other species.
Now if the ring-spots were inherited as such, the
existence of a hornless species with ring-spots
would be an insoluble riddle, and would favour the
admission of parallel developmental series, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
again could be scarcely otherwise explained than
by a “fixed direction of variation.” We have here
one of that class of cases which the supporters
of a phyletic vital force have already so often made
use of in support of their view.</p>

<p>The explanation of such a case&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> its reference
to known causes of species transformation&mdash;is
never easy, and is indeed impossible without a
precise knowledge of the ontogeny of many species,
as well as of the original significance of the characters
in question. In the case of the <i>Deilephila</i>
larvæ, however, such knowledge is still wanting.
It is true that they present us with parallel developmental
series, but these do not depend on an
unknown phyletic force&mdash;the parallelism can be
referred to the action of the imperfectly known
laws of growth innate in segmented organisms.
Because the characters of one segment have a
tendency to repeat themselves on the others, from
one parent-form possessing ring-spots on one segment
only, there may have proceeded several
developmental series, all of which developed rows
of such spots independently of each other.</p>

<p>From these considerations we may venture to
construct the following genealogical <span class="locked">tree:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The circles indicate the phyletic stages IV.-VIII.; the eighth

chiefly by the ontogeny, in the third stage of which the seventh
phyletic stage is reached, whilst in <i>Euphorbiæ</i> and <i>Dahlii</i> this

stages indicated by queries are extinct, and only known through the
ontogeny of existing species. It must be understood that this
pedigree expresses only the ideal and not the actual relations of

must, however, have possessed the same marking, and so on.</p></div>

Four parallel series here proceed from the
parent-form <i>Hippophaës</i>; there may have been
five, or possibly only three, but the incomplete
state of our knowledge of the ontogeny does not
permit of any certain conclusion. For the point
under consideration this is, however, quite immaterial.
The distance from the central point (the
parent-form) indicates the grade of phyletic development
which the respective species have at
present reached.</p>

<p>There is another case which is no less instructive,
because it reveals, although in a somewhat
different manner, the action of a law of growth
innate in the organism itself, but which can nevertheless
by no means be regarded as equivalent to
a phyletic vital force. I refer to the coloured
edges of the oblique stripes which occur in most
of the species of the genus <i>Sphinx</i>. It has already
been insisted upon in a previous section, that the
mode in which this character originates negatives
the assumption of a phyletic force, because these
coloured edges are gradually built up out of irregularly
scattered spots. There is no occasion for
a “developmental force” to grope in the dark;
if such a power exists, we should expect that it
would add new characters to old ones with the
precision of a master workman.</p>

<p>If, however, the coloured edges certainly depend
on natural selection, this agency causing the
scattered spots to coalesce and become linear, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
have here the proof that such spots first arose in a
precisely similar manner in several species, quite independently
of one another&mdash;that, in fact, a “fixed
direction of variation” in a certain sense exists.</p>

<p>In three species of <i>Smerinthus</i>-larvæ, red spots
appear towards the end of the ontogeny; in <i>S.
Populi</i> and <i>Ocellatus</i> in only a minority of individuals,
and always separate (not coalescent),
and in <i>S. Tiliæ</i> in a majority of specimens,
the spots frequently becoming fused into one
large, single, longish marking. These three
species cannot have inherited the spots from a
common ancestor, since they are absent in the
younger ontogenetic stages, or occur only exceptionally,
becoming larger and more numerous in
the last stage; they obviously form a character
which must be considered as a case of “anticipated
development.”</p>

<p>How is it then that three species vary independently
of each other in an analogous manner?
I know of no other answer to this question than
that similar variations must necessarily arise from
similar physical constitutions&mdash;or, otherwise expressed,
the three species have inherited from an
unknown parent species, devoid of spots, not this
last character itself, but a physical constitution,
having a tendency to the formation of red spots
on the <span class="locked">skin.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></span> The case offers many analogies to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
that of the colour varieties of <i>Lacerta Muralis</i>, to
which <span class="locked">Eimer<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></span> briefly calls attention in his interesting
communications on the blue lizard of the
Faraglioni Rocks at Capri. The South Italian
lizards, although having differently formed skulls,
show the same brilliantly coloured varieties as
those of North Italy; and Eimer believes that
these parallel variations in widely separated
localities, some of which have long been isolated,
must be referred to a tendency towards fixed
directions of variation innate in the constitution
of the species.</p>

<p>I long ago <span class="locked">insisted<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></span> that it should not be forgotten
that natural selection is, in the first place,
dependent upon the variations which an organism
offers to this agency, and that, although the number
of possible variations may be very great for each
species, yet this number is by no means to be
considered as literally infinite. For every species
there may be <i>impossible</i> variations. For this
reason I am of opinion that the physical nature
of each species is of no less importance in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
production of new characters than natural selection,
which must always, in the first place, operate upon
the results of this physical nature, <i>i.e.</i> upon the
variations presented, and can thus call new ones
into existence.</p>

<p>It requires but a slight alteration of the definition
to make out of this “restricted” or “limited
variability,” which is the necessary consequence of
the physical nature of each species, a “fixed
direction of variation” in the sense of a phyletic
vital force. Instead of&mdash;the <i>Smerinthus</i>-larvæ
show a tendency to produce red spots on the
skin, it is only necessary to say&mdash;these larvæ tend
to produce red borders to the oblique stripes.
The latter statement would, however, be incorrect,
since the red borders first arose by the coalescence
of red spots through the action of natural selection.
It is not even correct to say that <i>all</i> the
species of <i>Smerinthus</i> show this tendency to
produce spots, since this character does not seem
to occur either in <i>S. Quercus</i> or <i>S. Tremulæ</i>.</p>

<p>The distinction between the two modes of conception
will become clear if we ask, as an example,
whether those <i>Chærocampa</i>-larvæ which do not at
present possess eye-spots will subsequently acquire
these markings, supposing that they maintain their
existence on the earth for a sufficient period?</p>

<p>The supporters of a “fixed direction of variation”
would answer this question in the affirmative.
Ocelli constitute a character which occurs in nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
all the species of the group&mdash;they are the goal
towards which the phyletic force is urging, and
which must sooner or later be reached by each
member of the group. On the other hand, I
cannot express so decidedly my own opinion, viz.,
that such complicated characters as the many-coloured
oblique stripes or eye-spots are never
the results of purely internal forces, but always
arise by the action of natural selection, <i>i.e.</i> by the
combination of such minute and simple variations
as may present themselves. It may be replied
that the formation of eye-spots in those species
which are at present devoid of them, cannot indeed
be considered impossible, but that they would
only appear if the constitution of these species
had a tendency to give rise to the production of
darker spots on the edge of the subdorsal line,
and if at the same time, the possession of eye-spots
would be of use to the caterpillar under its
special conditions of life.</p>

<p>The condition of affairs would be quite different
if we were simply concerned with the transference
of a character from one segment on which it was
already present, to the remaining segments. The
transference would, in this case, result from causes
purely innate in the organism&mdash;from the action of
laws of equilibration or of growth (correlation), and
the external conditions of life would play only a negative
part, since they might prevent the complete
reproduction of a character, such, for example, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
eye-spots, on all the segments, in cases where it was
disadvantageous to the species. The fact that our
species of <i>Chærocampa</i> have only faint indications,
and not a completely-developed eye-spot, on the
remaining segments, may perhaps be explained in
this manner. It is conceivable that the two pairs
of ocelli on the front segments are more effective as
a means of alarm than if the insects were provided
with two long rows of such markings; but nothing
can be stated with certainty on this point until
experiments have been made with caterpillars
having rows of eye-spots.</p>

<p>The question raised above&mdash;whether the species
of <i>Chærocampa</i> at present devoid of eye-spots are
to be expected to acquire this character in the
course of their further phyletic development&mdash;brings
with it another point, which cannot be here
passed over.</p>

<p>If the <i>utility</i> of the four kinds of markings in
their perfected form is demonstrated, their origination
through natural selection is not, strictly
speaking, thereby proved. It must also be shown
that the first rudiments of these characters were
also of use to their possessors. The question as
to the utility of the “initial stages” of useful
characters must here be set at rest.</p>

<p>In the case of markings such as longitudinal
and oblique stripes, it is quite evident that the
initial stages of these simple characters do not
differ greatly from the perfected marking, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
this is certainly not the case with eye- and ring-spots.
The most light is thrown upon this question
by the latter, because a species which has remained
at the initial stage of the formation of ring-spots
here presents itself for examination, viz. <i>Deilephila
Hippophaës</i>.</p>

<p>I have attempted to show that the orange-red
spots, which, as a rule, adorn only the eleventh
segment, enhance the adaptive colouring of this
caterpillar by their resemblance to the berries of the
sea-buckthorn, whilst the general surface resembles
the leaves in colour. If this be admitted, the
origination of these spots by natural selection
offers no difficulty, since a smaller spot, or one of
a fainter red, must also be of some use to its
possessor.</p>

<p>This case is of importance, as showing that a
“change of function” may occur in markings, just
as it does in certain organs among the most
diverse species of animals, in the course of phyletic
development. The spots which in <i>Hippophaës</i>
are imitations of red berries, in species which have
further advanced phyletically play quite another
part&mdash;they serve as means of alarm, or signals of
distastefulness.</p>

<p>It appears to me very improbable, however,
that the perfect ocelli of the <i>Chærocampa</i>-larvæ
have also undergone such a “functional change”
(Dohrn). I rather believe that the first rudiments
of these markings produced the same effect as that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
which they now exercise, viz., terror. We are
certainly not so favourably circumstanced in this
case in knowing a species which shows the initial
steps of this character in its last stage of life; but
in the initial steps which the second stage of certain
species present, we see preserved the form under
which the eye-spots first appeared in the phylogeny,
and from this we are enabled to judge with some
certainty of the effect which they must have
produced at the time.</p>

<p>In the ontogeny of <i>C. Elpenor</i> and <i>Porcellus</i>
we see that a small curvature of the subdorsal
line first arises, the concavity of which becomes
filled with darker green, and soon afterwards with
black; the upwardly curved piece of the subdorsal
then becomes detached and more completely
surrounded by black. The white fragment of the
subdorsal which has become separated, in the next
place broadens, and a black (dark) pupil appears
in its centre.</p>

<p>Now the first rudiments of the eye-spot certainly
appear very insignificant in a caterpillar two
centimeters long, but we must not forget that in
the ancestors of the existing <i>Chærocampa</i>-larvæ
this character appeared in the adult state. If we
conceive the curvature of the white subdorsal with
the underlying dark pigment to be correspondingly
magnified, its importance as a means of alarm can
scarcely be denied, particularly when we consider
that this marking stands on the enlarged fourth segment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
which alone invests the caterpillar with a singular,
and, to smaller foes, an alarming appearance.
We know that in the case of those <i>Chærocampa</i>-larvæ
which possess no eye-spots, the distension of
this segment is employed against hostile attacks.
(See the illustration of <i>Darapsa Chærilus</i>, <a href="#Plate_IV">Pl. IV</a>.,
Fig. 34.) Those markings which even only remotely
resembled an eye must, in such a position,
have increased the terrifying action. On
these grounds I believe that it may be safely
admitted, that this kind of marking possessed the
same significance in its initial stages as it now
does when fully perfected. No functional change
has here taken place.</p>

<p>Among all the facts brought together in the
first section I only know of one group of
phenomena which at least permit of an attempt to
refer them to a phyletic vital force. This is the
occurrence of dark ground-colours in adult larvæ
which are of light colours in their young condition.
I have already attempted to show that in the
<i>Chærocampa</i>-larvæ this change of colour depends
on a double adaptation, the young caterpillars
being adapted to the green colour of the plant
and the adults to the soil and dead leaves. This
interpretation appears the more correct when we
find the same process, viz. the gradual replacement
of the original green by brown colours, among
species of widely different genera, which, with
the dark colouring, possess the necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
correlated habit of hiding themselves by day
when in the adult condition. This is the case
with <i>Sphinx Convolvuli</i>, <i>Deilephila Vespertilio</i>,
and <i>Acherontia Atropos</i>.</p>

<p>Thus far all has been easily explicable by natural
selection; but when we also see a “tendency” to
acquire a dark colour in the course of development,
in those species which neither conceal
themselves nor are adaptively coloured, but are
very conspicuously marked&mdash;and if, further, it can
be shown that these species, such for instance as
<i>Deilephila Galii</i>, actually possess immunity from
the attacks of foes,&mdash;how can this tendency to the
formation of a dark colour be otherwise explained
than by the admission of a phyletic vital force
urging the variations in this direction?</p>

<p>Nevertheless I believe that also on this point
an appeal to unknown forces can be dispensed
with. In the first place, dark ground-colours can
be of use to a species otherwise than as means of
adaptation. In <i>D. Galii</i>, as well as in <i>D. Euphorbiæ</i>,
the light ring-spots appear rather at their
brightest on the pitchy-black ground; and if this
caterpillar must (<i>sit venia verbo!</i>) become conspicuous,
this purpose would be best attained by
acquiring a dark ground-colour, such as that of
<i>D. Euphorbiæ</i>.</p>

<p>The tendency, apparently common to all these
<i>Sphingidæ</i>, to acquire a dark colour with increasing
age, depends therefore on two quite distinct adaptations&mdash;first,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
in species sought by enemies, on an
adaptation to the colour of the soil; and secondly,
in species rejected by foes, on the endeavour to
produce the greatest possible contrast of colour.</p>

<p>Moreover, the supposition from which this last
plea for a vital force set out is not universally
correct, since there are species, such for instance
as <i>D. Nicæa</i>, which never acquire a dark colour;
and in <i>D. Galii</i> also, although all the individuals
abandon the protective green of the young stages,
they by no means all acquire a dark hue in exchange
for this colour; many individuals in their
light ochreous-yellow colouring rather strikingly
resemble the snake-like caterpillar of <i>D. Nicæa</i>.</p>

<h4 id="P2-1-7">VII.<br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Phyletic Development of the Markings of
the Sphingidæ: Summary and Conclusion.</span></span></h4>

<p>If, from the form possessed by many of the caterpillars
of the <i>Sphingidæ</i> on their emergence from
the egg, we may venture to draw a conclusion
concerning the oldest phyletic stage, these larvæ
were originally completely destitute of marking.
The characteristic caudal horn must be older
than the existing markings, since it is present in
the younger stages (except in cases where it is
altogether wanting), and is generally even larger
than at a later age.</p>

<p>There is, however, further evidence that there
were once Sphinx-larvæ without any markings.
Such a species now exists. I do not mean the
boring caterpillars of the <i>Sesiidæ</i>,<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> which live in the
dark, and are therefore colourless, but I refer to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
large larva (over six centimeters long) preserved in
spirit in the Berlin <span class="locked">Museum,<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></span> which, from its form,
belongs to the <i>Smerinthus</i> group. It possesses a
caudal horn, and on the whole upper surface is
covered with short and sparsely scattered bristles,
such as occur in the <i>Sesiidæ</i>. The colour of this
unknown insect appears to have been light green,
although it now shows only a yellowish shade.
Every trace of marking is absent, and it thus
corresponds exactly with the youngest stages of
the majority of the existing Sphinx-larvæ&mdash;even
to the short bristles sparsely scattered over the
whole upper surface of its body. We have therefore,
so to speak, a living fossil before us, and it
would be of great interest to ascertain its history.</p>

<p>All the data furnished by the developmental
history go to show that of the three kinds of
markings which occur in the <i>Sphingidæ</i>, viz.,
longitudinal and oblique stripes and spots, the
first is the oldest. Among the species which are
ornamented with oblique stripes or spots there are
many which are longitudinally striped in their
young stages, but the reverse case never occurs&mdash;young
larvæ never show spots or oblique stripes
when the adult is only striped longitudinally.</p>

<p>The first and oldest marking of the caterpillars
of the <i>Sphingidæ</i> was therefore the longitudinal
striping, or, more precisely speaking, the subdorsal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
to which dorsal and spiracular lines may have
been added. That this second stage of phyletic
development has also been preserved in existing
species has already been sufficiently shown; the
greater portion of one group, the <i>Macroglossinæ</i>,
has indeed remained at this stage of development.</p>

<p>From the biological value which must be attributed
to this kind of marking, its origination by
natural selection presents no difficulty. The first
rudiments of striping must have been useful, since
they must have broken up the large surface of the
body of the caterpillar into several portions, and
would thus have rendered it less conspicuous to its
enemies.</p>

<p>Thus it is not difficult to perceive how a whole
group of genera could have made shift with this
low grade of marking up to the present time.
Colour and marking are not the only means of
offence and defence possessed by these insects; and
it is just such simply-marked larvæ as those of the
<i>Macroglossinæ</i> which have the protective habit of
feeding only at night, and of concealing themselves
by day. Moreover, under certain conditions of
life the longitudinal stripes may be a better means
of protection, even for a Sphinx-larva, than any
other marking; and all those species in which this
pattern is retained at the present time live either
among grasses or on <i>Coniferæ</i>.</p>

<p>It cannot be properly said that the second form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
of marking&mdash;the oblique stripes&mdash;has been developed
out of the first. If these had arisen by
the transformation of the longitudinal stripes, the
two forms could not exist side by side. This is
the case, however, both in certain species in the
adult state (<i>Calymnia Panopus</i><a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a>), as well as in
others during their young stages (most beautifully
seen in <i>Smerinthus Populi</i>, <a href="#Plate_VI">Fig. 56</a>). Various facts
tend to show that the oblique stripes appeared in
the phyletic development <i>later</i> than the longitudinal
lines. In the first place they appear later
than the latter in the ontogeny of certain species.
This is the case with <i>Chærocampa Elpenor</i> and
<i>Porcellus</i>, in which, however, they certainly do
not reach a high state of development. Then
again, the longitudinal lines disappear completely
in the course of the ontogeny, whilst the oblique
stripes alone maintain their ground. Thus, the
subdorsal line vanishes at a very early stage, with
the exception of a small <span class="locked">residue,<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></span> in all native
species of <i>Smerinthus</i>. I have already attempted
to show that new characters are only acquired <i>in
the last stage</i>, and that if still newer ones are then
added, the former disappear from the last stage,
and are transferred back to a younger one.
<i>Characters vanish therefore from a stage in the
same order as they were acquired.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
Finally, among the genera with longitudinal
stripes (<i>e.g. Macroglossa</i>) we know certain species
which, when at an advanced age, possess oblique
stripes (<i>M. Fuciformis</i>), although these slant in a
direction opposite to those of most of the other
larvæ of the <i>Sphingidæ</i>. These are, however,
always species which differ from their allies in their
mode of life, not feeding on grasses or low plants,
but on large-leaved shrubs. If we were able to
ascertain the ontogeny of these species, we should
find that the oblique stripes appeared late in life,
as has already been shown in the case of <i>Pterogon
Œnotheræ</i>.</p>

<p>If it be asked why the longitudinal lines were
first formed, and then the oblique stripes, it may
be replied that the physical constitution of these
caterpillars would be more easily able to give rise
to simple longitudinal lines than to complicated
oblique stripes crossing their <span class="locked">segments.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></span> It may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
perhaps also be suggested that the oldest <i>Sphingidæ</i>
lived entirely on low plants among grasses, and in
the course of time gradually took to shrubs and
trees. At the present time the majority of the
Sphinx-larvæ still live on low plants, and but few
on trees, such caterpillars generally belonging to
certain special genera.</p>

<p>The character of oblique stripes becomes perfected
by the addition of coloured edges, the
latter, as is self-evident, having been added subsesequently.</p>

<p>The third chief constituent of the Sphinx-markings,
<i>i.e.</i> the spots&mdash;whether perfect ocelli or only
ring-spots&mdash;in two of the special genera here considered,
arise on the subdorsal, where they are
either deposited (<i>Deilephila</i>), or built up from a
fragment of this line (<i>Chærocampa</i>). That these
markings can, however, also originate independently
of the subdorsal, is shown by the ocellus of
<i>Pterogon Œnotheræ</i>, situated on the segment
bearing the caudal horn. In this case, however,
the ontogeny teaches us that the spot also succeeds
the subdorsal, so that we can state generally that
all these spot-markings are of later origin than the
longitudinal striping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
The question as to the relative ages of the
oblique stripes and the spot-marking does not
admit of a general answer. In some cases (<i>C.
Elpenor</i> and <i>Porcellus</i>) the oblique stripes disappear
when the ocelli reach complete development,
and we may therefore venture to conclude that in
these cases the former appeared earlier in the
phylogeny. But it is very probable that oblique
stripes arose independently at different periods,
just as longitudinal lines occur irregularly in quite
distinct families. It would be a great error if we
were to ascribe the possession of oblique stripes
solely to descent from a common ancestor. The
oblique markings found on certain species of
<i>Macroglossa</i> (<i>M. Corythus</i> from India) have not
been inherited from a remote period, but have been
independently acquired by this or by some recent
ancestral species. They have nothing to do
<i>genetically</i> with the oblique stripes which occur in
some species of <i>Chærocampa</i> (<i>e.g.</i> in <i>C. Nessus</i>,
from India), or with those of the species of
<i>Smerinthus</i> and <i>Sphinx</i>. They depend simply
on analogous adaptation (Seidlitz<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a>), <i>i.e.</i> on adaptation
to an analogous environment.</p>

<p>The case is similar with the spot-markings. I
have already shown that under certain conditions
ring-spots may assume the exact appearance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
eye-spots by the formation of a nucleus in the
“mirror,” such as occurs occasionally in <i>Deilephila
Euphorbiæ</i> (<a href="#Plate_V">Fig. 43</a>), more frequently in <i>D. Galii</i>,
and as a rule in <i>D. Vespertilio</i>. Nevertheless,
these markings arise in quite another manner to
the eye-spots of the <i>Chærocampinæ</i>, with which
they consequently have no genetic relation; the two
genera became separated at a time when they
neither possessed spot-markings. Further, in
<i>Pterogon Œnotheræ</i> we find a third kind of spot-marking,
which is most closely allied to the ocelli
of the <i>Chærocampa</i>-larvæ, but is situated in quite
another position, and must have originated in
another manner, and consequently quite independently
of these eye-spots.</p>

<p>It can also be readily understood why the first
and second elements of the markings of the <i>Sphingidæ</i>
should be mutually exclusive, and not the
second and third or the first and third.</p>

<p>A light longitudinal line cutting the oblique
stripes, considerably diminishes that resemblance
to a leaf towards which the latter have a tendency,
and it is therefore only found in cases where an
adaptive marking can be of no effect on account of
the small size of the caterpillar, <i>i.e.</i> in quite young
stages. (See, for instance, <a href="#Plate_VI">Fig. 56</a>, the first stage
of <i>S. Populi</i>.) At a later period of life the old
marking must give way to the new, and we accordingly
find that the subdorsal line vanishes from all
the segments on which oblique stripes are situated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
and is only retained on the anterior segments
where the latter are wanting. In some few cases
both elements of marking certainly occur together,
such as in <i>Calymnia Panopus</i> and <i>Macroglossa
Corythus</i>; but the oblique stripes are, under these
circumstances, shorter, and do not extend above
the subdorsal line, and in <i>Darapsa Chœrilus</i> even
become fused into the <span class="locked">latter.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></span></p>

<p>In certain cases there may also be a special leaf
structure imitated by the longitudinal lines, but
on the whole the latter diminish the effect of the
oblique stripes; and we accordingly find that not
only has the subdorsal disappeared from those
segments with oblique stripes, but that most larvæ
with this last character are also without the otherwise
broad spiracular and dorsal lines. This is
the case with all the species of <i>Smerinthus</i><a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
to me, as well as with all the species of the genera
<i>Sphinx</i>, <i>Dolba</i>, and <i>Acherontia</i>.</p>

<p>Oblique stripes and spot-markings are not,
however, necessarily mutually exclusive in their
action, and we also find these in certain cases
united in the same larva, although certainly never
in an equal state of perfection. Thus, <i>Chærocampa
Nessus</i><a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> possesses strongly marked oblique stripes,
but feebly developed ocelli; and, on the other
hand, <i>Chærocampa Elpenor</i> shows strongly developed
eye-spots, but the earlier oblique stripes
are at most only present as faint traces. This is
easily explained by the mode of life. These caterpillars&mdash;at
least such of them as are perfectly
known&mdash;do not live on plants with large, strongly-ribbed
leaves, and are even in the majority of
individuals adapted to the colour of the soil; the
oblique stripes have therefore in these cases
only the significance of rudimentary formations.</p>

<p>That the first and third forms of markings also
are not always mutually prejudicial in their action
is shown by the case of <i>Chærocampa Tersa</i>, in
which the eye-spots certainly appear to possess
some other significance than as a means of causing
terror. In most of the <i>Chærocampa</i>-larvæ the
subdorsal line disappears in the course of the
phylogeny, and it can be understood that the
illusive appearance of the eye-spots would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
more perfect if they did not stand upon a white
line.</p>

<p>If we consider the small number of facts with
which I have here been able to deal, the result
of these investigations will not be deemed unsatisfactory.
It has been possible to show that each
of the three chief elements of the markings of the
<i>Sphingidæ</i> have a biological significance, and their
origin by means of natural selection has thus been
made to appear probable. It has further been
possible to show that the first rudiments of these
markings must also have been of use; and it thus
appears to me that their origin by means of natural
selection has been proved to demonstration.
Moreover, it has not been difficult to understand
the displacement of the primary elements of the
markings by secondary characters added at a later
period, as likewise an essential effect of natural
selection. Finally, it has been possible to explain
also the subordinate or accessory elements of the
markings, partly by the action of natural selection,
and partly as the result of markings formerly
present acting by correlation.</p>

<p>From the origin and gradual evolution of the
markings of the <i>Sphingidæ</i> we may accordingly
sketch the following <span class="locked">picture:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The oldest Sphinx-larvæ were without markings;
they were probably protected only by adaptive
colouring, and a large caudal horn, and by being
armed with short bristles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
Their successors, through natural selection, became
longitudinally striped; they acquired a subdorsal
line extending from the horn to the head, as
well as a spiracular, and sometimes also a dorsal,
line. The caterpillars thus marked must have
been best hidden on those plants in which an
arrangement of parallel linear parts predominated;
and we may venture to suppose that at this period
most of the larvæ of the <i>Sphingidæ</i> lived on or
among such plants (grasses).</p>

<p>At a later period oblique stripes were added to
the longitudinal lines, the former (almost always)
slanting across the seven hindmost segments from
the back towards the feet in the direction of the
caudal horn. Whether these stripes all arose
simultaneously, or, as is more probable, whether
only one at first appeared, which was then transferred
to the other segments by correlation
assisted by natural selection, cannot, at least
from the facts available, at present be determined.</p>

<p>On the whole, as the oblique stripes became
lengthened towards the back, the longitudinal lines
disappeared, since they injured the deceptive effect
of the stripes. In many species also there were
formed dark or variegated coloured edges to the
oblique stripes, in imitation of the shadow lines cast
by the leaf-ribs.</p>

<p>Whilst one group of <i>Sphingidæ</i> (<i>Sphinx</i>, <i>Smerinthus</i>)
were thus striving to make their external
appearance approximate more and more to that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
a ribbed leaf, others of the longitudinally striped
species became developed in another manner.</p>

<p>Some of the latter lived indeed on bush-like
leaved plants, but no oblique stripes were developed,
because these would have been useless
among the dense, narrow, and feebly-ribbed leaves
of the food-plants. These caterpillars, from the
earlier markings, simply retained the longitudinal
lines, which, combined with a very close resemblance
to the colour of the leaves, afforded them a
high degree of protection against discovery. This
protection would also have been enhanced if other
parts of the food-plant, such as the berries (<i>Hippophaës</i>),
were imitated in colour and position in
such a manner that the large body of the caterpillar
contrasted still less with its environment. In this
way the first ring-spot probably arose in some
species on only one&mdash;the penultimate segment.</p>

<p>As soon as this first pair of ring-spots had become
an established character of the species, they
had a tendency to become repeated on the other
segments, advancing from the hind segments
towards the front ones. Under certain conditions
this repetition of the ring-spots might have been of
great disadvantage to the species, and would therefore
have been as far as possible prevented by
natural selection (<i>Hippophaës</i>); in other cases, however,
no disadvantage would have resulted&mdash;the
caterpillar, well adapted to the colour of its food-plant,
would not have been made more conspicuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
by the small ring-spots, which might thus have
become repeated on all the segments (<i>Zygophylli</i>).
In cases like the two latter, striking colours must
have been eliminated when inherited from an immediate
ancestor; but on this point nothing can
as yet be said with certainty.</p>

<p>In other cases the repetition of the ring-spots
with strongly contrasted colours was neither prejudicial
nor indifferent, but could be turned to the
further advantage of the species. If a caterpillar
fed on plants containing acrid juices (<i>Euphorbiaceæ</i>)
which, by permeating its alimentary system, rendered
it repulsive to other animals, the ring-spots
commencing to appear (by repetition) would furnish
an easy means for natural selection to adorn
the species with brilliant colours, which would
protect it from attack by acting as signals of distastefulness.</p>

<p>But if the dark spots stood on a light ground
(<i>Nicæa</i>), they would present the appearance of
eyes, and cause their possessors to appear alarming
to smaller foes.</p>

<p>From the developmental histories and biological
data at present before us, it cannot with certainty
be said which of these two functions of the ring-spots
was first acquired in the phylogeny, but we
may perhaps suppose that their significance as a
means of causing alarm was arrived at finally.</p>

<p>It may also be easily conceived that as the ring-spots
became more and more complicated, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
would occasionally have played other parts, being
fashioned once again in these stages into imitations
of portions of plants, such as a row of berries or
flower-buds. For this, however, there is as yet no
positive evidence.</p>

<p>As the ring-spots became detached from the
subdorsal line out of which they had arisen, the
latter disappeared more and more completely
from the last ontogenetic stage, and receded
towards the younger stages of life of the caterpillar&mdash;it
became <i>historical</i>. This disappearance of the
subdorsal may also be explained by the fact that
the original longitudinal stripe imitating the linear
arrangement of leaves would become meaningless,
even if it did not always diminish the effect of the
ring-spots. But characters which have become
worthless are known in the course of time to
become rudimentary, and finally to disappear
altogether. I do not believe that disuse alone
causes such characters to vanish, although in the
case of active organs it may have a large share in
this suppression. With markings it cannot, however,
be a question of use or disuse&mdash;nevertheless
they gradually disappear as soon as they become
meaningless. I consider this to be the effect of
the arrest of the controlling action of natural
selection upon these characters (suspension of the
so-called “conservative adaptation,” Seidlitz).
Any variations may become of value if the character
concerned is met with in the necessary state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
fluctuation. That this process of extinction does
not proceed rapidly, but rather with extreme
slowness, is seen in the ontogeny of several species
of <i>Deilephila</i>, which retain the now meaningless
subdorsal line through a whole series of stages of
life.</p>

<p>In another group of Sphinx-larvæ with longitudinal
stripes, an eye-spot became developed independently
of the subdorsal line, in the position of
the caudal horn, which has here vanished with the
exception of a small knob-like swelling. This
character&mdash;which we now see perfected in <i>Pterogon
Œnotheræ</i>&mdash;undoubtedly serves as a means
of causing terror; but whether the incipient stages
possessed the same significance, cannot be decided
in the isolated case offered by the one species of
the genus <i>Pterogon</i> possessing this marking.</p>

<p>In a third group of longitudinally striped caterpillars,
the younger genus <i>Chærocampa</i>, eye-spots
were developed directly from portions of the
subdorsal line, at first only on the fourth and fifth
segments. It can be here positively asserted that
this character served as a means of alarm from its
very commencement. It is certainly for this reason
that we see the subdorsal line in the immediate
neighbourhood of the spots disappear at an early
stage, whilst it is retained on the other segments
for a longer period. A portion of the younger
(tropical) species of this group then developed
similar, or nearly similar, ocelli on the remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
segments by correlation; and it may now have
occurred that in solitary cases the eye-spots
acquired another significance (<i>C. Tersa</i>?), becoming
of use as a disguise by resembling berries or
flower-buds. It is also conceivable that the eye-spots
may in other cases have been converted
into a warning sign of distastefulness.</p>

<p>In all those larvæ which possessed purely terrifying
markings, however, not only was the original
protective colouring preserved, but in most of them
this colour gradually became replaced by a better
one (adaptation of the adult larva to the soil).
The oblique stripes imitating the leaf-ribs also are
by no means lost, but are almost always present,
although but feebly developed, and often only
temporarily.</p>

<p>The pattern formed by the oblique stripes may
also be retained, even with perfect adaptation to
the soil, and may be converted to a new use by
losing its sharpness, and, instead of imitating definite
parts of plants, may become transformed into
an irregular and confused marking, and thus best
serve to represent the complicated lights and
shadows, stripes, spots, &amp;c., cast on the ground
under low-growing plants from between the stems
and dead leaves.</p>

<p>Just as in the case of ocellated species where caterpillars
without eye-spots may retain and newly
utilize their older markings, so larvæ having oblique
stripes with the most diversely coloured edges may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
show the same markings in allied (younger?)
species, both in a rudimentary and in a transformed
condition. These markings may thus contribute
to the formation of a latticed or reticulated pattern.
Even the oldest marking, the subdorsal line, may
still play a part, since its remnants cause certain
portions of the complicated pattern to appear more
strongly marked (<i>S. Convolvuli</i>). Finally, when
an adaptation to a changing environment intersected
by lights and shadows is required, new
markings may be here added as in other cases,
viz., dark streaks extending over the light surface
of the whole caterpillar.</p>

<p>In concluding this essay, I may remark that,
with respect to the wide and generally important
question which gave rise to these investigations,
a clearer and simpler result has been obtained than
could have been expected, considering the complexity
of the characters requiring to be traced
to their causes, as well as our still highly imperfect
knowledge of ontogenetic and biological facts.</p>

<p>For a long time I believed that it was not
possible to trace all the forms of marking and their
combinations to those causes which are known to
produce transformation; I expected that there
would be an inexplicable residue.</p>

<p>But this is not the case. Although it cannot
yet be stated at first sight with certainty in every
single instance how far any particular element of
marking may have a biological value in the species<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
possessing it, nevertheless it has been established
that each of the elements of marking occurring in
the larvæ of the <i>Sphingidæ</i> originally possessed a
decided biological significance, which was produced
by natural selection.</p>

<p>In the case of the three chief elements of the
markings of the <i>Sphingidæ</i>, it can be further
shown that not only the initial stages but also their
ultimate perfection&mdash;the highest stages of their
development, are of decided advantage to their
possessors, and have a distinct biological value, so
that the gradual development and improvement of
these characters can be traced to the action of
natural selection.</p>

<p>But although natural selection is the factor
which has called into existence and perfected the
three chief forms and certain of the subsidiary
markings, in the repetition of the local character
on the other segments, as well as in the formation
of new elements of marking at the points of intersection
of older characters now rudimentary, we
can recognize a second factor which must be
entirely innate in the organism, and which governs
the uniformity of the bodily structure in such a
manner that no part can become changed without
exerting a certain action on the other parts&mdash;an
innate law of growth (Darwin’s “correlation”).</p>

<p>Only once during the whole course of the investigations
was it for an instant doubtful whether
a phyletic vital force did not make itself apparent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
viz., in the red spots accompanying the oblique
stripes in several <i>Smerinthus</i>-larvæ. Closer
analysis, however, enabled us to perceive most
distinctly the wide gulf that separates “analogous
variation” from the mystic phyletic vital force.
Nothing further remains therefore for the action
of this force in respect to the marking and colouring
of the <i>Sphingidæ</i>, since several even of the
subordinate markings can be traced to their
causes, only the “dorsal spots” of our two native
species of <i>Chærocampa</i> having been referred to correlation
without decided proof. From the temporary
inability to explain satisfactorily such an
insignificant detail, no one will, however, infer
the existence of such a cumbrous power as a
phyletic vital force.</p>

<p>The final result to which these investigations
have led us is therefore the following:&mdash;The
action of a phyletic vital force cannot be recognized
in the marking and colouring of the <i>Sphingidæ</i>;
the origination and perfection of these characters
depend entirely on the known factors of natural
selection and correlation.</p>

<span class="subhead">ON PHYLETIC PARALLELISM IN METAMORPHIC
SPECIES.</span></h3>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h4 id="P2-2-Intro">INTRODUCTION.</h4>

<p>In the previous essay I attempted to trace a
whole group of apparently “purely morphological”
characters to the action of known factors
of transformation, to explain them completely by
these factors, and in this manner I endeavoured
to exclude the operation of an internal power
inciting change (phyletic vital force).</p>

<p>In this second study I have attempted to solve
the problem as to whether such an innate inciting
power can be shown to exist by comparing the
forms of the two chief stages of metamorphic
species, or whether such a force can be dispensed
with.</p>

<p>Nobody has as yet apparently entertained the
idea of testing this question by those species which
appear in the two forms of larva and imago
(insects), or, expressed in more general terms, by
those species the individuals of which successively
possess quite different forms (metamorphosis), or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
in which the different forms that occur are distributed
among different individuals alternating
with and proceeding from one another (alternation
of generation). Nevertheless, it is precisely here
that quite distinct form-relationships would be
expected according as the development of the
organic world depended on a phyletic vital force,
or was simply the response of the specific organism
to the action of the environment.</p>

<p>Assuming the first to be the case, there must
have occurred, and must still occur, what I designate
“phyletic parallelism,” <i>i.e.</i> the two stages of
metamorphic species must have undergone a precisely
parallel development&mdash;every change in the
butterfly must have been accompanied or followed
by a change in the caterpillar, and the systematic
groups of the butterflies must be also found in a
precisely corresponding manner in a systematic
grouping of the caterpillars. If species are able
to fashion themselves into new forms by an innate
power causing periodic change, this re-moulding
cannot possibly affect only one single stage of
development&mdash;such as the larva only&mdash;but would
rather extend, either contemporaneously or successively,
to all stages&mdash;larva, pupa, and imago:
each stage would acquire a new form, and it might
even be expected that each would change to the
same extent. At least, it cannot be perceived
why a purely internal force should influence the
development of one stage more than that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
another. The larvæ and imagines of two species
must differ from one another to the same extent,
and the same must hold good for the larvæ and
imagines of two genera, families, and so forth. In
brief, a larval system must completely coincide
with the system based entirely on imaginal characters,
or, what amounts to the same thing,
the form-relationships of the larvæ must correspond
exactly with the form-relationships of the
imagines.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the condition of affairs must
be quite different if an internal power causing
phyletic remodelling does not exist, the transformation
of species depending entirely on the action of
the environment. In this case dissimilarities in
the phyletic development of the different stages of
life must be expected, since the temporary, and
often widely deviating, conditions of life in the
two stages can and must frequently influence the
one stage whilst leaving the other unacted upon&mdash;the
former can therefore undergo remodelling
while the latter remains <span class="locked">unchanged.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
By this means there would arise an unequal
difference between the two stages of two species.
Thus, the butterflies, supposing these to have
become changed, would bear a more remote form-relationship
to each other than the caterpillars,
and the differences between the former (imagines)
would always be greater than that between the
larvæ if the butterflies were, at several successive
periods, affected by changing influences whilst the
larvæ continued under the same conditions and
accordingly remained unaltered. The two stages
would not coincide in their phyletic development&mdash;the
latter could not be expressed by parallel lines,
and we should accordingly expect to find that
there was by no means a complete congruity
between the systems founded on the larval and
imaginal characters respectively, but rather that
the caterpillars frequently formed different systematic
groups to the <span class="locked">butterflies.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></span></p>

<p>Accordingly, the problem to be investigated
was whether in those species which develope by
means of metamorphosis, and of which the individual
stages exist under very different conditions
of life, a complete phyletic parallelism was to be
found or not. This cannot be decided <i>directly</i>
since we cannot see the phyletic development
unfolded under our observation, but it can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
established <i>indirectly</i> by examining and comparing
with each other the form-relationships of the
two separate stages&mdash;by confronting the larval
and imaginal systematic groups. If the phyletic
development has been parallel and perfectly equal,
so also must its end-results&mdash;the forms at present
existing&mdash;stand at equal distances from one
another; larval and imaginal systems must coincide
and be <i>congruent</i>. If the course of the
phyletic development has not been parallel, there
must appear inequalities&mdash;incongruences between
the two systems.</p>

<p>I am certain that systematists of the old school
will read these lines with dismay. Do we not
regard it as a considerable advance in taxonomy
that we have generally ceased to classify species
simply according to one or to some few characters,
and that we now take into consideration not
merely the last stage of the development (the
imago), but likewise the widely divergent young
stages (larva and pupa)? And now shall it not
be investigated whether caterpillars and butterflies
do not form quite distinct systems? In the case
of new species of butterflies of doubtful systematic
position was not always the first question:&mdash;what
is the nature of the caterpillars? and did not this
frequently throw light upon the relationships of the
imago? Assuredly; and without any doubt we
have been quite correct in taking the larval structure
into consideration. But in so doing we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
should always keep in mind that there are two
kinds of relationship&mdash;form- and blood-relationship&mdash;which
might possibly not always coincide.</p>

<p>It has hitherto been tacitly assumed that the
degree of relationship between the imagines is
always the same as that between the larvæ, and if
blood-relationship is spoken of this must naturally
be the case, since the larva and the imago are the
same individual. In all groups of animals we have
not always the means of deciding strictly between
form- and blood-relationship, and must accordingly
frequently content ourselves by taking simply the
form-relationship as the basis of our systems,
although the latter may not always express the
blood-relationship. But it is exactly in the
case of metamorphic species that there is no
necessity for, nor ought we to remain satisfied with,
this mode of procedure, since we have here two
kinds of form-relationship, that of the larvæ and
that of the imagines, and, as I have just attempted
to show, it is by no means self-evident that these
always agree; there are indeed already a sufficient
number of instances to show that such agreement
does not generally exist.</p>

<p>This want of coincidence is strikingly shown in
a group of animals widely remote from the Insecta,
viz. the Hydromedusæ, the systematic arrangement
of which is quite different according as this
is based on the polypoid or on the medusoid generation.
Thus, the medusoid family of the oceanic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
Hydrozoa springs from polypites belonging to
quite different families, and in each of these polypoid
families there are species which produce
<i>Medusæ</i> of another family.</p>

<p>Similarly, the larvæ of the Ophiuroidea (<i>Pluteus</i>-form)
among the Echinodermata are not the most
closely related in form to those of the ordinary
star-fishes, but rather to the larvæ of quite a
distinct order, the sea-urchins.</p>

<p>I will not assert that in these two cases the
dissimilarity in the form-relationship, or, as I may
designate it, the incongruence of the morphological
systems, must depend on an unequal rate of phyletic
development in the two stages or generations, or
that this incongruence can be completely explained
by the admission of such an unequal rate of development:
indeed it appears to me probable that,
at least in the <i>Ophiureæ</i>, quite another factor is
concerned&mdash;that the form-relationship to the larvæ
of the sea-urchins does not depend upon blood-relationship,
but on convergence (Oscar Schmidt),
<i>i.e.</i> on adaptation to similar conditions of life.
These two cases, however, show that unequal
form-relationship of two stages may occur.</p>

<p>From such instances we certainly cannot infer
off-hand that a phyletic force does not exist; it
must first be investigated whether and to what
extent such dissimilarities can be referred to unequal
phyletic development and, should this be the case,
whether deviations from a strict congruence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
morphological systems are not compatible with
the admission of an internal transforming power.
<i>That a certain amount</i> of influence is exerted by
the environment on the course of the processes of
development of the organic world, will however be
acceded to by the defenders of the phyletic vital
force. It must therefore be demonstrated that
deviations from complete congruence occur, which,
from their nature or magnitude, are incompatible
with the admission of innate powers, and, on the
other hand, it must likewise be attempted to show
that the departures from this congruence as well
as the congruence itself can be explained without
admitting a phyletic vital force.</p>

<p>In the following pages I shall attempt to solve
this question for the order Lepidoptera, with the
occasional assistance of two other orders of insects.
Neither the Echinodermata nor the Hydromedusæ
are at present adapted to such a critical examination;
the number of species in these groups
of which the development has been established
with certainty is still too small, and their biological
conditions are still to a great extent unknown.
In both these respects they are far surpassed by
the Lepidoptera. In this group we know a large
number of species in the two chief stages of their
development and likewise more or less exactly the
conditions under which they exist during each of
these phases. We are thus able to judge, at least
to a certain extent, what changes in the conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
of life produce changes of structure. Neither in
the number of known species of larvæ, nor in the
intimate knowledge of their mode of life, can any
of the remaining orders of insects compete with the
Lepidoptera. There is no Dipterous or Hymenopterous
genus in which ten or more species are so
intimately known in the larval stage that they can
be employed for the purposes of morphological
comparison. Who is able to define the distinctions
between the life-conditions of the larvæ of twenty
different species of <i>Culex</i> or of <i>Tipula</i>? The
caterpillars of closely allied species of Lepidoptera,
on the other hand, frequently live on different
plants, from which circumstance alone a certain
difference in the life-conditions is brought about.</p>

<p>The chief question which the research had to
reply to was the following:&mdash;Does there exist a
complete phyletic parallelism among Lepidoptera
or not? or, more precisely speaking:&mdash;Can we
infer, from the form-relationships which at present
exist between larvæ on the one hand and
imagines on the other, an exactly parallel course
of phyletic development in both stages; or do
incongruences of form-relationship exist which
point to unequal development?</p>

<p>Before I proceed to the solution of this question
it is indispensable that one point should be cleared
up which has not been hitherto touched upon,
but which must be settled before the problem
can be formally stated in general terms. Before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
it can be asked whether larvæ and imagines have
undergone a precisely parallel development, we
must know whether unequal development is possible&mdash;whether
there does not exist such an
intimate structural relationship between the two
stages that every change in one of these must
bring about a change in the other. Were this the
case, every change in the butterfly would cause a
correlative change in the caterpillar, and <i>vice versâ</i>,
so that an inequality of form-relationship between
the larvæ on one hand and the imagines on
the other would be inconceivable&mdash;systems based
on the characters of the caterpillars would completely
coincide with those based on the characters
of the butterflies and we should arrive at a false
conclusion if we attributed the phyletically parallel
development of the two stages to the existence
of an internal phyletic force, whilst it was only
the known factor, correlation, which caused the
equality of the course of development.</p>

<p>For these reasons it must first be established
that the larva and imago are not respectively fixed
in form, and the whole of the first section will therefore
be devoted to proving that the two stages
change independently of one another. Conclusions
as to the causes of change will then be drawn, and
these will corroborate from another side a subsequent
inquiry as to the presence or absence of complete
congruence in the two morphological systems.
The two questions the answers to which will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
successively attempted are by no means identical,
although closely related, since it is quite conceivable
that the first may be answered by there
being no precise correlation of form, or only an
extremely small correlation, between the caterpillar
and the imago, whilst, at the same time, it would
not be thereby decided whether the phyletic
development of the two stages had kept pace
uniformly or not. A perfect congruence of morphological
relationships could only take place if
transformations resulted from an internal power
instead of external influences. The question:&mdash;Does
there exist a fixed correlation of form
between the two stages? must therefore be
followed by another:&mdash;Do the form-relationships
of the two stages coincide or not&mdash;has their
phyletic development been uniform or not?</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Larva and Imago vary in Structure independently
of each other.</span></span></h4>

<p>It would be meaningless to assert that the two
stages above mentioned were <i>completely</i> independent
of one another. It is obvious that the amount
of organic and living matter contained in the caterpillar
determines the size of the butterfly, and that
the quantity of organic matter in the egg must determine
the size of the emergent larva. The assertion
in the above heading refers only to the
structure; but even for this it cannot be taken as
signifying an absolute, but only a relative independence,
which, however, certainly obtains in a
very high degree. Although it is conceivable
that every change of structure in the imago may
entail a correlative change of structure in the larva,
no such cases have as yet been proved; on the
contrary, all facts indicate an almost complete independence
of the two stages. It is quite different
with cases of <i>indirect</i> dependence, such, for example,
as are brought about by ‘nurse-breeding.’ This
phenomenon is almost completely absent in Lepidoptera,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
but is found in Diptera, and especially in
Hymenoptera in every degree. The larvæ of
ichneumons which live in other insects, require
(not always, but in most instances) that the female
imago should possess a sharp ovipositor, so that
in this case also the structure and mode of life of
the larva influences the perfect insect. This does
not depend, however, on inherent laws of growth
(correlation), but on the action of external
influences, to which the organism endeavours to
adapt itself by natural selection.</p>

<p>I will now let the facts speak for themselves.</p>

<p>It is shown by those species in which only one
stage is di- or polymorphic that not every change
in the one stage entails a corresponding change
in the other. Thus, in all seasonally dimorphic
species we find that the caterpillars of butterflies
which are often widely different in the colour
and marking of their successive generations are
absolutely identical. On the other hand, many
species can be adduced of which the larvæ are
dimorphic whilst the imagines occur only in one
form (compare the first and second essays in this
volume).</p>

<p>There are however facts which directly prove
that any one stage can change independently of
the others; I refer to the circumstance that any
one stage may become independently variable&mdash;that
the property of greater variability or of
greater constancy by no means always occurs in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
equal degree in all the three stages of larva, pupa,
and imago, but that sometimes the caterpillar is
very variable and the pupa and imago quite
constant. On the other hand, all three stages may
be equally variable or equally constant, although
this seldom occurs.</p>

<p>If variability is to be understood as indicating
the period of re-modelling of a living form, whether
in its totality or only in single characters or groups
of characters, from the simple fact of the heterochronic
variability of the ontogenetic stages, it follows
that the latter can be modified individually,
and that the re-modelling of one stage by no
means necessarily entails that of the others. It
cannot however be doubted that variability, from
whatever cause it may have arisen, is in all cases
competent to produce a new form. From the
continued crossing of variable individuals alone,
an equalization of differences must at length take
place, and with this a new, although not always a
widely deviating, constant form must arise.</p>

<p>That the different stages of development of a
species may actually be partly variable and partly
constant, and that the variable or constant character
of one stage has no influence on the other
stages, is shown by the following cases, which are,
at the same time, well adapted to throw light on
the causes of variability, and are thus calculated to
contribute towards the solution of the main problem
with which this investigation is concerned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span></p>

<p>When, in the following pages, I speak of
<i>variability</i>, I do not refer to the occurrence of local
varieties, or to variations which occur in the course
of time, but I mean a high degree of individual
variability&mdash;a considerable fluctuation of characters
in the individuals of one and the same district or of
the same brood. I consider a species to be constant,
on the other hand, when the individuals from
a small or large district differ from one another
only to a very slight extent. Constant forms are
likewise generally, but not invariably, such as are
poor in local varieties, whilst variable forms are
those which are rich in such variations. Since the
terms “variable” and “constant” are but relative,
I will confine myself to the most extreme cases,
those in which the individual peculiarities fluctuate
within very wide or very narrow limits.</p>

<p>As no observations upon the degree of variability
shown by a species in the different stages of
its development were available, I was obliged to
fall back upon my own, at least so far as relates
to the larval and pupal stages, whilst for the
imaginal stage the wide experience of my esteemed
friend Dr. Staudinger has been of essential service
to me.</p>

<p>Let us in the first place confine our attention to
the three chief forms which every Lepidopteron
presents, viz. larva, pupa, and imago. With
respect to the constancy or variability of these
three forms, we actually find in nature all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
combinations which are theoretically conceivable.</p>

<p>(1.) There are species which possess a high
degree of constancy in all three stages, such, for
example, as <i>Limenitis Camilla</i>, <i>Pieris Brassicæ</i>,<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a>
<i>Sphinx Ligustri</i>, and <i>Euchelia Jacobææ</i>.</p>

<p>(2.) There are species showing a high degree
of variability in all three stages. This case must
be of rare occurrence, as I am only able to adduce
<i>Araschnia Prorsa-Levana</i>, a fact which arises
from the circumstance that the pupal stage is, as a
rule, but seldom variable.</p>

<p>(3.) There are species which are variable in two
stages and constant in the third. To this class,
for example, belongs <i>Smerinthus Tiliæ</i>, of which
the larva and imago are very variable, whilst the
pupa is quite constant. The same is the case
with <i>Lasiocampa Pini</i>, the well-known fir moth.
Many butterflies show this same phenomenon in
other combinations, such, for instance, as <i>Vanessa
Urticæ</i> and <i>Polychloros</i>, in which the larva and
pupa are very variable, and the imago very constant.
In a less degree the same is also the case
with <i>Vanessa Atalanta</i>, whilst in <i>Pieris Napi</i> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
pupa and imago are variable, and the caterpillar
remarkably constant, this likewise being the case
with the local form <i>Bryoniæ</i>, which, according to my
theory, is to be regarded as the parent form of
<i>Napi</i> (See <a href="#P1">Part I.</a> of the present volume).</p>

<p>(4.) There are species which are constant in
two stages, and variable only in the third. Thus,
a few species can be found in which the larva and
pupa are constant and the imago variable. This
is the case with <i>Saturnia Yamamai</i>, the imago of
which is well known to present numberless shades
of colour, varying from light yellow to greyish
black, whilst the green caterpillar shows only
slight individual differences of marking, and
scarcely any differences of colour. The pupa of
this species is quite constant. <i>Arctia Caja</i> and
<i>Hebe</i>, and <i>Chelonia Plantaginis</i> belong to this
same category.</p>

<p>There are a very large number of species which
possess very constant imagines and pupæ, but
extremely variable larvæ. The following are the
cases known to me:&mdash;<i>Macroglossa Stellatarum</i>,
<i>Fuciformis</i> and <i>Bombyliformis</i>; <i>Chærocampa
Elpenor</i>, <i>Celerio</i>, and <i>Nerii</i>; <i>Deilephila Galii</i>,
<i>Livornica</i>, Hübn., <i>Hippophaës</i>, <i>Vespertilio</i>, and
<i>Zygophylli</i>; <i>Sphinx Convolvuli</i>; <i>Acherontia Atropos</i>;
<i>Smerinthus Ocellatus</i> and <i>Tiliæ</i>; <i>Callimorpha
Hera</i>; <i>Cucullia Verbasci</i> and <i>Scrophulariæ</i>.</p>

<p>Cases in which the variability depends entirely
upon the pupa, while the larva and imago are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
extremely constant, are of great rarity. <i>Vanessa Io</i>
is a case in point, the pupa being light or dark
brown, or bright golden green, whilst in the two
other stages scarcely any light shades of colour or
variations in the very complicated marking are to
be met with.</p>

<p>The facts thus justify the above view that the
individual stages of development change independently&mdash;that
a change occurring in one stage is
without influence on the preceding and succeeding
stages. Were this not the case no one stage
could possibly become variable without all the
other stages becoming so. Did there exist a
correlation between larvæ, pupæ, and imagines of
such a nature that every change in the larva
entailed a corresponding change in the imago, as
soon as a large number of larval characters became
fluctuating (<i>i.e.</i> as soon as this stage became
variable), a large number of imaginal characters
would necessarily also become fluctuating (<i>i.e.</i>
this stage would also become correspondingly
variable).</p>

<p>There is one other interpretation which might
perhaps be attempted from the point of view of
the old doctrine of species. It might be said that
it is a special property of certain larval or imaginal
markings to be variable whilst others are constant,
and since the larval and imaginal markings of a
species are generally quite distinct, it may easily
happen that a butterfly possessing markings having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
the property of constancy may belong to a caterpillar
having variable markings.</p>

<p>There is a soul of truth underlying this objection,
since it is true that the various forms of
markings which occur in Lepidoptera apparently
reach different degrees of constancy. If we speak
of the constancy or variability of a species, a
different meaning is attached to these expressions
according as we are dealing <i>e.g.</i> with a species of
<i>Sphinx</i> or a species of <i>Arctia</i>. That which in
the latter would be estimated as a high degree of
constancy, in the former would be taken as a considerable
amount of variability. It is of interest,
in connection with the question as to the causes of
constancy, to note that the power of any form of
marking to attain to a high degree of constancy is
by no means inversely proportional to the complication
of the marking, as would have been expected
<i>à priori</i>.</p>

<p>Thus, the species of <i>Sphinx</i> and of allied
genera possess on their fore-wings, which are
mostly coloured with a mixture of dull grey, white
and black, an exceedingly complicated arrangement
of lines which, in constant species, show a
high degree of uniformity: on the other hand, the
checquered fore-wings of our <i>Arctiidæ</i>, which are
far more coarsely marked, always show, even in
the most constant species, well-marked individual
differences. The different types of marking must
therefore be measured by different standards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span></p>

<p>But in granting this, we decidedly refute the
statement that constancy and variability are inherent
properties of certain forms of marking.</p>

<p>This reasoning is based on the simple fact that
a given type of marking comprises both species of
great constancy and of (relatively) great variability.</p>

<p>Thus, the fore-wings of <i>Sphinx Ligustri</i> and
<i>S. Convolvuli</i> are extremely constant, whilst the
very similarly marked <i>Anceryx (Hyloicus) Pinastri</i>
is exceedingly variable. Similarly <i>Deilephila
Euphorbiæ</i> is known by its great variability
of colouring and marking, whilst <i>D. Galii</i>, which
resembles this species so closely as to be sometimes
confounded with it, possesses a high degree
of constancy, and further, the Corsican and Sardinian
<i>D. Dahlii</i> is very variable. Among the
family <i>Arctiidæ</i>, <i>Callimorpha Hera</i> and the Alpine
<i>Arctia Flavia</i> are cases of constancy, whilst <i>A.
Caja</i>, which is so similar to the last species, is so
generally variable that two perfectly identical
specimens can scarcely be found together.</p>

<p>The same can be shown to hold good for the
markings of caterpillars. Thus, the larva of <i>D.
Dahlii</i> shows very considerable variability, whilst
that of <i>D. Galii</i> is very constant in marking (disregarding
the ground-colour). So also the larva
of <i>Vanessa Urticæ</i> is very variable and that of <i>V.
Antiopa</i> very constant, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The great differences with respect to constancy
or variability which are displayed by the different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
stages of one and the same species, must therefore
find their explanation elsewhere than in the type
of the marking itself. The explanation must be
found in the circumstance that each stage changes
independently of the others, and at different
periods can enter a new phase of variability.</p>

<p>We are here led in anticipation to the main
question:&mdash;Are changes produced by internal or
external causes? is it the physical nature of the
organism which is compelled to become remoulded
spontaneously after the lapse of a certain
period of time? or does such modification only
occur when produced directly or indirectly by the
external conditions of life?</p>

<p>In the cases before us the facts undoubtedly
indicate a complete dependence of the transformations
upon external conditions of life.</p>

<p>The independent appearance of variability in
the separate stages of the metamorphosis might,
however, be regarded as only apparent. It might
still be attempted to attribute the changes to a
purely inherent cause, <i>i.e.</i>, to a phyletic vital force,
by assuming that the latter acts periodically in
such a manner that at first one and then the following
stage becomes variable, until finally the
entire species is transformed.</p>

<p>There is but little to be said in reply to this if
we once take refuge in entirely unknown forces,
the operation of which can be arbitrarily conceived
to be either constant or periodic.</p>

<p>But granting that such a transforming power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
exists and acts periodically, the variability must
always pass over the different stages in a fixed
direction, like a wave over the surface of water&mdash;imago,
pupa, and larva, or larva, pupa, and
imago, must <i>successively</i> become variable. Cases
like that of <i>Araschnia Prorsa</i>, in which all three
stages are variable, may certainly be thus explained,
but those instances in which the larva
and imago are extremely variable, and the pupa
quite constant, are entirely inexplicable from this
point of view.</p>

<p>The latter can, however, be very simply explained
if we suppose the changes to be dependent
upon external influences. From this standpoint
we not only see how it is possible that an
intermediate stage should remain uninfluenced by
the changes which affect the two other stages, but
we can also understand why it should just be the
pupal stage that plays this part so frequently. If
we ask why most pupæ are constant and are relatively
but very slightly variable, the answer will
be found in the facts that all pupæ which remain
concealed in the earth or inside plants (<i>Sesiidæ</i>),
or which are protected by stout cocoons, show
complete constancy, whilst any considerable
amount of variability occurs only in those pupæ
which are suspended or openly exposed. This is
closely connected with a fact to which I have
called attention on a former <span class="locked">occasion,<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></span> viz., that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
dimorphism occurs in certain pupæ, but only in
those which are openly exposed and which are
therefore visible to their foes. I am only acquainted
with such cases among the pupæ of
butterflies, and it is likewise only among these
that I have found any considerable amount of
variability.</p>

<p>Facts of this kind indicate that Nature does
not uselessly sport with forms, but that at any
rate changes of this sort result from external
influences. The greater frequency of variability
among larvæ and its comparative rarity in imagines
is also undoubtedly in favour of this view.</p>

<p>It has already been shown that species with
variable larvæ and constant imagines are extremely
common, but that those with constant larvæ and
variable imagines are very rare. This confirms
the conclusions, already drawn above, first, that
the variability of the imago cannot owe its existence
to the variability of the larvæ, and secondly,
that the causes which produce variability affect
the larval condition more commonly than that of
the imago.</p>

<p>Where can these causes be otherwise sought
than in the external conditions of life, which are
so widely different in the two stages, and which
are much more variable for the larva than for the
imago?</p>

<p>Let us take the species of one genus, <i>e.g.</i> those
of <i>Deilephila</i>. The imagines of our European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
species&mdash;as far as we know&mdash;all live in precisely
the same manner; they all fly at <span class="locked">twilight,<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></span> showing
a preference for the same flowers and very
often frequenting the same spots, so that in the
haunts of one species the others are almost always
to be met with, supposing them to occur in the
same locality. They conceal themselves by day
in similar places, and are attacked by similar
foes.</p>

<p>It is quite different with the caterpillars. These,
even in the case of the most closely allied species,
live under different conditions, as appears from the
fact that they feed on different plants. The latter
can, however, produce changes both directly and
indirectly. The larvæ may acquire adaptive
colours and markings, and these would vary in
accordance with the colour and structure of the
food-plant; or they may become brightly coloured
as a sign of distastefulness in cases where they are
inedible. Then again the colour of the soil on
which the larvæ live would act upon their colours
making these adaptive. Certain habits of the
caterpillars may also be dependent upon the
nature of their food-plants. Thus, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Deilephila
Hippophaës</i> feeds only at night, and conceals
itself by day under moss and among the leaves at
the base of the food-plant; but <i>D. Euphorbiæ</i>
could not acquire such a habit, because <i>Euphorbia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
Cyparissias</i> generally grows on arid soil which is
poor in vegetation, and which therefore affords no
concealment, and furthermore, because a caterpillar,
as long as it continues to feed, cannot, and
as a matter of fact does not, ever wander far from
its food-plant. A habit of concealment by burying
in the earth also, such for example as occurs
in <i>Acherontia Atropos</i>, could not be acquired by
<i>D. Euphorbiæ</i>, because its food-plant generally
grows on hard, dry, and stony ground.</p>

<p>In addition to these considerations, the foes
would be different according as the caterpillar
lived on plants which formed dense thickets
covering large extents of the shore (<i>Hippophae</i>) or
grew isolated on dry hillocks and declivities where
the herbage was scanty or altogether absent; or
again, according as the insect, in conjunction with
such local differences, fed by day or had acquired
the habit of feeding only by night. It must in fact
be admitted that new and improved adaptations,
or, in more general terms, that inducements to
change, when depending on the environment, must
be more frequently dissimilar for larvæ than for
the imagines. We must accordingly expect to find
actual change, or that condition of variability which
may be regarded as initiative to change, occurring
more commonly in larvæ than in perfect insects.</p>

<p>Since facts are in complete accordance with the
results of these <i>à priori</i> considerations we may also
venture to conclude that the basis of the considerations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
is likewise correct, viz., the supposition that
the changes of colour and marking in caterpillars,
pupæ, and imagines result from external influences
only.</p>

<p>This must not be taken as signifying that the
single stages of the larval development are also
only able to change through the action of external
influences. The larval stages are correlated with
each other, as has already been shown (see the
previous essay): new characters arise in the adult
caterpillar at the last stage and are then gradually
transferred back to the younger stages quite independently
of external influences, this recession
being entirely brought about by the laws of correlation.
Natural selection here only exerts a secondary
action, since it can accelerate or retard this transference,
according as the new characters are advantageous
or disadvantageous to the younger stages.</p>

<p>Now as considerable individual differences
appear in the first acquisition of a new character
with respect to the rapidity and completeness with
which the individuals acquire such a character,
the same must obtain for the transference of an
improvement acquired in the last stage to the next
younger stage. The new character would be
acquired by different individuals in different degrees
and at different rates&mdash;it would have, to a certain
extent, to struggle with the older characters of the
stage; in brief, the younger stage would become
variable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span></p>

<p>Variability of this kind might well be designated
as <i>secondary</i>, in contradistinction to <i>primary</i> variability;
the latter (primary) depends upon an unequal
reaction of the individual organisms to
external influences, the former (secondary) results
from the unequal strength and rate of the action of
the innate laws of growth governing the organism.
In both cases alike exceeding variability may
occur, but the causes producing this variability are
dissimilar.</p>

<p>The different stages of larval development would
thus frequently display independent variability in a
manner similar to the pupal or imaginal stages,
since they can show individual variability while the
other stages of development remain constant. This
appearance of independent variability in the different
stages of the larval development, however,
is in truth deceptive&mdash;we have here in fact a kind
of wave of variability, which passes downwards
through the developmental stages, becoming
gradually weaker, and finally dying out completely.</p>

<p>In accordance with this, we very frequently find
that only the last or two last stages are variable,
while the younger stages are constant. Thus in
<i>Macroglossa Stellatarum</i>, the larvæ are constant in
the first, second, and third stages, but become variable
in the fourth, and in the fifth stage first show
that high degree of variability which has already
been described in detail (See. <a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III</a>., Figs. 3&ndash;12).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
The larvæ, of <i>Vanessa Cardui</i> also, according to my
notes, are extremely constant in the first four
stages in spite of their complicated marking, but
become variable in the fifth stage, although to no
very great extent.</p>

<p>In <i>Smerinthus Tiliæ</i>, <i>Ocellatus</i> and <i>Populi</i> also,
the greatest larval variability is shown only in the
last stage, the preceding stages being very constant.
These cases by no means depend upon
the marking of the young stages being simpler
and therefore being less capable of varying. The
reverse case also occurs. In a somewhat similar
manner as the young of the tapir and wild hog
are striped, while the adult animals are plainly
coloured, the young caterpillars of <i>Saturnia
Yamamai</i> possess longitudinal black lines on a
yellow ground, while as early as in the second
stage a simple green colour appears in the place
of this complicated but perfectly constant marking.
If the young stages are so frequently constant,
this rather depends upon the fact that the transference
of a new character to these stages not
only takes place gradually, but also with continually
diminishing energy, in a manner somewhat similar
to physical motion, which continually diminishes
in speed by the action of resistance till it is completely
arrested. This constancy of the younger
stages may further be due to the circumstance
that the characters would only be transferred when
they had become fixed in the last stage, and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
consequently no longer variable. The transferred
characters may thus have acquired a greater regularity,
<i>i.e.</i> a less degree of variability, than they
possessed at their first origination. Extensive
investigations in this special direction must be
made if the precise laws, in accordance with
which the backward transference of new characters
takes place, are to be discovered. By such researches
only should we arrive with certainty at
the causes which determine the lesser variability of
the young larval stages.</p>

<p>It may also occur that the early stages are
variable, whilst the later stages are constant,
although this case appears to happen less frequently.
Thus, the caterpillars of <i>Gastropacha
Quercifolia</i> vary considerably in the second stage
but are constant at a later period, and the same is
the case with <i>Spilosoma Urticæ</i>, which in the
second stage may be almost considered to be dimorphic,
but which subsequently becomes constant.</p>

<p>Cases in which the first stage is variable appear
to be of the least frequent occurrence. I know of
only one such instance, viz., <i>Anceryx Pinastri</i>, of
which the newly hatched larvæ (<a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI</a>., Fig. 53)
show considerable differences in the brownish-black
crescentic spots. The second (<a href="#Plate_VI">Fig. 54</a>), third,
and fourth stages are then tolerably constant, while
the fifth stage again is very variable.</p>

<p>An instance of this kind can be easily explained
by two waves of variation, the first of which now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
affects only the first stage, while the second has
just commenced to affect the fifth stage. Such a
supposition is not opposed to any theoretical considerations,
but rather has much probability in its
favour, since we know that species are from time
to time subject to be remodelled; and further,
that the coalescence of several stages of phyletic
development in the ontogeny of one and the same
species (see p. <a href="#Page_226">226</a>, development of the genus
<i>Deilephila</i>) shows that during the backward
transference of one character, new characters may
appear in the last stage of the ontogeny, and indeed
very frequently at a time when the next
youngest character has not been transferred back
so far as to the first stage.</p>

<p>That this secondary variability is to a certain
extent brought about by the conflict between the
old and new characters, the latter striving to suppress
the former, is shown by the caterpillar of
<i>Saturnia Carpini</i> which I have observed for
many years from this point of view, and than
which I do not know a more beautiful illustration.</p>

<p>When these larvæ leave the egg they are black,
but in the adult state are almost bright green&mdash;this
at least being the case in a local form
which, from the district in the vicinity of Genoa
where it is found, I will designate as the var.
<i>Ligurica</i>. Now whilst these two extreme stages
of development are relatively constant, the intermediate
stages show a variability which becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
greater the nearer the last stage is approached,
this variation in the marking depending simply
on the struggle between the green colour and the
more anciently inherited black. In this manner
there arises, especially in the fourth stage of the
German local form, an incredible mixture of the
most diverse markings, all of which can, however,
be very easily explained from the foregoing point
of view.</p>

<p>The simpler and, as I am inclined to believe,
the older form of the transformation is presented
to us in the local variety <i>Ligurica</i>. In the last
stage, when 7.5 centimeters long, this form is of a
beautiful bright green colour without any trace
of black <span class="locked">marking<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></span> (<a href="#Plate_VIII">Pl. VIII</a>., Fig. 77). The
colour of the six orange warts which are situated
on each segment is also similar in all specimens,
so that this stage is perfectly constant.</p>

<p>Our German <i>S. Carpini</i> shows different characters
in the fifth stage. It is true that individual
specimens occur which are entirely green without
any black, but these are rare; the majority possess
a more or less broad black ring encircling the
middle of each segment (<a href="#Plate_VIII">Pl. VIII</a>., Figs. 78 and
79). Those specimens in which the black ring
has become broken up into large or small spots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
surrounding the base of the warts constitute intermediate
forms (<a href="#Plate_VIII">Fig. 80</a>). The last stage of the
German local form, unlike that of the Genoese
local form, is therefore very variable.</p>

<p>The two forms, moreover, do not simply differ
in being more or less advanced in phyletic
development, but also in several other points.
As it is of great theoretical interest to show that
a species can develop local differences only in the
stage of larva, I will here subjoin the plain facts.</p>

<p>The differences consist in that the Genoese
local form goes through five moults whilst the
German local form, like most caterpillars, has only
four moults. Further, in the Genoese form the
light green, which is also possessed by the German
form in the fourth stage, when it once appears, is
retained to the end of the larval development,
whilst in the fifth stage of the German form this
colour is replaced by a dull greyish-green (compare
<a href="#Plate_VIII">Figs. 77 and 78</a>). There is further a very
considerable difference in the earlier stages which
shows that the phyletic transforming process has
taken a quite independent course in the two forms.
Since the struggle between the green and black&mdash;retaining
this idea&mdash;appears to be quite finished
in the last stage of the Genoese form, we should
expect that the new colour, green, would now also
have encroached further upon the younger stages
than in the German form. Nevertheless, this is
not the case, but quite the reverse happens, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
black maintaining its ground longer in the Italian
than in the German form.</p>

<p>In the Genoese form the two first stages are
completely black, and in the third stage an orange-yellow
lateral stripe first appears. In the German
form this stripe appears in the second stage, and
there is not subsequently added, at least on the
middle segments, a yellow border surrounding
some of the warts of the median series. In the
third stage, however, the yellow (which is but the
precursor of the later green colour) becomes
further extended, so that the caterpillars often
appear of an orange colour, some or all of the
warts and certain spots and stripes only being
black (<a href="#Plate_VII">Figs. 66 and 68</a>). The warts are also
often yellow while the ground remains in most
part black&mdash;in brief, the bright colour is in full
struggle with the black, and an endless series of
variations is the result of this conflict, whilst in the
corresponding stage of the Genoese form almost
complete constancy prevails.</p>

<p>This constancy remains also in the following
(fourth) stage, the caterpillar still being deep
black, only the yellow (sulphur-coloured) lateral
stripe, which has now become brighter, indicating
the impending change (<a href="#Plate_VII">Fig. 67</a>). This takes
place in the fifth stage, in which the ground-colour
suddenly becomes bright green, the black
remaining at most only in traces on the anterior
edges of the segments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span></p>

<p>This is the same marking as is shown by the
fourth stage of the German form, only in this case
individuals quite destitute of black do not occur.
In many specimens indeed black forms the ground-colour,
the green only appearing in certain spots
(<a href="#Plate_VIII">Figs. 71 to 75</a>); in others the green predominates,
and these two extremes are connected by innumerable
intermediate forms, so that this stage
must be regarded as the most variable of all.</p>

<p>The sixth stage of the Genoese and the fifth of
the German form have already been compared
together. The results may be thus <span class="locked">tabulated:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>
<i>A. German form.</i>                  <i>B. Genoese form.</i><br />
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
                                   <span class="smcap">Stage VII.</span> Pupation.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span></p>

<p>From this comparison we perceive that the
process of transformation has at least become preliminarily
concluded in the Genoese form. Why
the backward transference of the newly-acquired
character to the young stages has not yet occurred,
or, at least, why it is not in progress, does not
appear; neither can it be stated whether this will
take place later, although we may venture to suppose
that such will be the case. At first sight but
a relatively short time appears necessary for the
single stage V., which is still in a state of fluctuation
(variable), to become constant by continued
crossing, like all the other stages.</p>

<p>That the transformation is still in full progress
in the German form, is shown by the fact that in
this case all the stages are variable with the exception
of the first&mdash;the second stage being only
variable to a small extent, the third to a much
greater extent, and the fourth to the highest
degree conceivable, whilst the fifth and last stage
is again less variable&mdash;so that the greatest struggle
between the old and new characters takes place in
the fourth stage.</p>

<p>Among the innumerable variations presented by
this last stage a complete series of transitional
forms can be arranged so as to show the gradual
conquest of the black by the green, and thus
indicating, step by step, the course which the
latter colour has taken.</p>

<p>In the blackest specimens there is nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
green but the lateral (infra-spiracular) line which
was yellow in the preceding stage, and a crescent-shaped
streak at the base of the middle warts
together with a still smaller crescent at the base of
the upper warts (<a href="#Plate_VIII">Figs. 71 and 81</a>). These spots
become extended in lighter specimens and approximate
so as to leave only narrow black bridges,
a third spot being added at the posterior edge of
the warts (<a href="#Plate_VIII">Figs. 72 and 82</a>). The three spots then
extend on all sides, still leaving for a long period
narrow black lines at the boundaries where their
growth has caused them to abut. In this manner
there frequently arises on the green ground a true
hieroglyphic-like marking (<a href="#Plate_VIII">Figs. 85 and 86</a>).
Finally the black disappears from the anterior
edge and diminishes on the middle line of the
back where it still partly remains as a T-shaped
figure (<a href="#Plate_VIII">Figs. 73 and 74</a>), although generally
replaced elsewhere by the green with the exception
of small residues.</p>

<p>One point remained for a long time inexplicable
to me, viz., the change of the light green into dark
grey-green which appeared in the last stage in
connection with a total change of the black marking.</p>

<p>Supposing that new characters are actually
acquired only in the last stage, and that from this
they are transferred to the younger stages, we
should expect to find completely developed in the
last stage the same colouring and markings as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
are possessed more or less incompletely in the
fourth stage. Now since the developmental tendency
to the removal of black and to the predominance
of green&mdash;if we may thus venture to
express it&mdash;is obvious in the fourth stage, we may
expect to find in the fifth stage a bright green
ground-colour, either without any mixture of black
or with such black spots and streaks as were
retained in the fourth stage as residues of the
original ground-colour. But instead of this the
fifth stage shows a dark green colour, and a more
or less developed black marking which cannot in
any way be derived from that of the fourth stage.</p>

<p>The Genoese local form observed last year first
gave me an explanation to the extent that in this
form the last stage is actually only the potential
penultimate stage, or, more correctly expressed,
that the same characters which at present distinguish
the last stage of this form, are already more
or less completely transferred to the penultimate
stage.</p>

<p>The apparently paradoxical behaviour of the
German form can be explained by supposing that
before the pure bright green had become completely
transferred to the penultimate stage a
further change appeared in the last stage, the
green ground-colour becoming darker, and black
transverse bands being formed. The marking of
the last stage would then be regarded as the
reverse of that of the preceding stage; the absence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
of black would be the older, simple black spots
at the base of the warts the next in succession,
and a connected black transverse band the most
advanced state of the development.</p>

<p>Whether this explanation is correct, and if so,
what causes have produced the second change,
may perhaps be learnt at some future time by a
comparison with the ontogeny of other <i>Saturniidæ</i>;
in the meantime this explanation receives support
from another side by the behaviour of the Genoese
local form. If the last stage of the German form
has actually commenced to be again re-modelled,
then this variety is further advanced in phyletic
development than the Genoese form; and this corresponds
entirely with the theory that in the former
the light colour (the orange considered as preliminary
to the transformation into green) has already
been carried down into the second stage, whilst in
the Genoese variety even in the fourth stage only
the first rudiments of the colour-transformation
show themselves.</p>

<p>The Genoese form is to a certain extent intermediate
between the German form of <i>Saturnia
Carpini</i> and the nearly related <i>S. Spini</i>, a species
inhabiting East Germany. In this latter the
larvæ, even in the adult state, are completely
black with yellow warts. This form of caterpillar
must therefore be regarded as phyletically the
oldest, and this very well agrees with the character
of the moth, which differs essentially from <i>S.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
Carpini</i> only in not being sexually dimorphic.
In <i>Carpini</i> the male possesses a far more brilliant
colouring than the female, the latter agreeing so
completely with the female of <i>Spini</i> that it can
hardly be distinguished therefrom, especially in
the case of the somewhat larger South European
specimens of the last species. Now as the more
simple colouring of the female must in any case be
regarded as the original form, we must consider
<i>Spini</i>, both sexes of which possess this colouring,
to be phyletically the older form, and <i>Carpini</i>, the
male of which has become differently coloured,
must be considered as the younger type. This
completely accords with the characters of the
larvæ.</p>

<p>I must here mention that I have also asked
myself the question whether the variations of the
different larval stages are connected together as
cause and effect&mdash;whether the lightest specimens
of the fifth stage may perhaps not also have been
the lightest individuals of the third and fourth
stages.</p>

<p>Such relationship is only apparent between the
third and fourth stages; the darkest larvæ of the
third stage become the darker varieties of the
fourth stage, although it is true that the lighter
forms of the third sometimes also become dark
varieties in the fourth stage. Between the fourth
and fifth stages there is scarcely any connection of
this kind to be recognized. Thus, the darkest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
varieties of the fourth stage sometimes become
the lightest forms of the fifth stage, whilst in other
cases from the lightest individuals of the fourth
stage there arise all the possible modifications of
the fifth stage. Further details may be omitted:
the negative result cannot cause any surprise, as
it is a necessary consequence of the continued
crossing that must take place.</p>

<p>We thus see that the three chief stages of
development (larva, pupa, and imago) actually
change in colour independently of each other, the
single stages of the larval development being
however in greater dependence upon one another,
and being connected indeed in such a manner that
a new character cannot be added to the last stage
without being transferred in the course of time to
the preceding stage, and at a later period from this
again even to the youngest stage, supposing it not
to be previously delayed in the course of its transference
by unknown opposing forces. On this
last point, however, the facts at present available
do not admit of any certain decision.</p>

<p>But why do the individual larval stages behave
in this respect so very differently to the chief stages
of the whole development? why are the former
so exactly correlated whilst the latter are not?
If new characters have a general tendency to become
transferred to the younger ontogenetic stages,
why are not new imaginal characters first transferred
to the pupa, and finally to the larva?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span></p>

<p>The answer to these questions is not far to find.
The wider two stages of a species differ in structure,
the less does correlation become possible;
the nearer the two stages are morphologically
related, the more powerful does the action of
correlation become. It is readily conceivable that
the more widely two succeeding stages deviate in
structure and mode of life, the less possible does
it become for characters to be transferred from
one to the other. How is it possible, for example,
that a new character in the proboscis or on the
wings of a butterfly can be transferred to the
caterpillar? If such correlation existed it could
only manifest itself by some other part of the
caterpillar changing in correspondence with the
change of the proboscis or wings of the butterfly.
That this is not the case has, in my opinion, been
conclusively shown by all the foregoing considerations
respecting the independent variability of the
chief stages of the metamorphosis.</p>

<p>There are, moreover, an endless number of
facts which prove the independence of the individual
stages of development&mdash;I refer to the multitudinous
phenomena presented by metamorphosis
itself. The existence of that form of development
which we designate as metamorphosis is
alone sufficient to prove incontestably that the
single stages are able to change independently
of one another to a most remarkable extent.</p>

<p>If we now ask the question: how has the so-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>called
“complete” metamorphosis of insects
arisen? the answer can only be: through the
gradual adaptation of the different stages of
development to conditions of life which have continually
deviated more and more widely from each
<span class="locked">other.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a></span></p>

<p>But if individual stages of the post-embryonic
development can finally attain to such complete
diversity of structure as that of the larva and imago
through gradual adaptations to continually diverging
conditions of life, this shows that the characters
acquired by the single stages are always only
transferred to the same stages of the following
generation, whilst the other stages remain uninfluenced
thereby. This depends upon that form
of heredity designated by Darwin “inheritance
at corresponding periods of life,” and by Haeckel
“homochronic heredity.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h4 id="P2-2-2">II.<br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Does the Form-relationship of the Larva
coincide with that of the Imago?</span></span></h4>

<p>Having thus established the independence in
the variability of the individual stages of metamorphosis,
I will now turn to the consideration
of the question as to how far a parallelism is
displayed in the phyletic development of these
stages. Is there a complete congruence of form-relationship
between larvæ on the one hand and
imagines on the other? does the classification
founded on the morphology of the imagines agree
with that based on the morphology of the larvæ
or not?</p>

<p>If, according to <span class="locked">Claus,<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a></span> we divide the order
Lepidoptera into six great groups of families, it is
at once seen that these groups, which were
originally founded exclusively on imaginal characters,
cannot by any means be so clearly and
sharply defined by the larval characters.</p>

<p>This is certainly the case with the <i>Geometræ</i>,
of which the larvæ possess only ten legs, and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
this account progress with that peculiar “looping”
movement which strikes even the uninitiated.
This group, which is very small, is however the
only one which can be founded on the morphology
of the larvæ; it comprises only two nearly
related families (<i>Phytometridæ</i> and <i>Dendrometridæ</i>),
and it is not yet decided whether these
should not be united into one group comprising the
family characters of the whole of the “loopers.”</p>

<p>Neither the group of Micro-lepidoptera, nor
those of the <i>Noctuina</i>, <i>Bombycina</i>, <i>Sphingina</i>, and
<i>Rhopalocera</i>, can be based systematically on larval
characters. Several of these groups are indeed
but indistinctly defined, and even the imagines
present no common characteristics by which the
groups can be sharply distinguished.</p>

<p>This is well shown by the <i>Rhopalocera</i> or butterflies.
These insects, in their large and generally
brilliantly coloured wings, which are usually
held erect when at rest, and in their clubbed
antennæ, possess characters which are nowhere else
found associated together, and which thus serve
to constitute them a sharply defined <span class="locked">group.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></span> The
caterpillars, however, show a quite different state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
of affairs. Although the larval structure is so
characteristic in the individual families of butterflies,
these “larval-families” cannot be united into
a larger group by any common characters, and the
“<i>Rhopalocera</i>” would never have been established
if only the larvæ had been known. It is
true that they all have sixteen legs, that they
never possess a Sphinx-like horn, and that they
are seldom hairy, as is the case with many <i>Bombycidæ</i>,<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a>
but these common <i>negative</i> characters
occur also in quite distinct groups.</p>

<p>In the butterflies, therefore, a perfect congruence
of form-relationship does not exist, inasmuch as
the imagines constitute one large group of higher
order whilst the larvæ can only be formed into
families. If it be admitted that the common
characters of butterflies depend on their derivation
from a common ancestor, the imagines must
have retained certain common characters which
enable them to be recognized as allies, whilst the
larvæ have preserved no such characters from the
period at which the families diverged.</p>

<p>Without going at present into the causes of
these phenomena I will pass on to the consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
of further facts, and will now proceed to investigate
both the form-relationships within the
families. Here there can be no doubt that in an
overwhelmingly large majority of cases the phyletic
development has proceeded with very close
parallelism in both stages; larval and imaginal
families agree almost completely.</p>

<p>Thus, under the group <i>Rhopalocera</i> there is a
series of families which equally well permit of
their being founded on the structure of the larva
or on that of the imago, and in which the larvæ
and imagines therefore deviate from one another
to the same extent. This is the case, for instance,
with the families of the <i>Pieridæ</i>, <i>Papilionidæ</i>,
<i>Danaidæ</i>, and <i>Lycænidæ</i>.</p>

<p>But there are also families of which the limits
would be very different if the larvæ were made the
basis of the classification instead of the butterflies
as heretofore. To this category belongs the sub-family
<i>Nymphalinæ</i>. Here also a very characteristic
form of caterpillar indeed prevails, but it
does not occur in all the genera, being replaced in
some by a quite different form of larva.</p>

<p>In the latest catalogue of Diurnal Lepidoptera,
that of Kirby (1871), 112 genera are comprised
under this family. Of these most of the larvæ
possess one or several rows of spines on most or
on all the segments, a character which, as thus disposed,
is not met with in any other family.</p>

<p>This character is noticeable in genera 1 to 90,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
if, from those genera of which the larvæ are known,
we may draw a conclusion with reference to their
allies. I am acquainted with larvæ of genus 2,
<i>Agraulis</i>, Boisd. (<i>Dione</i>, Hübn.); of genus 3,
<i>Cethosia</i>, Fabr.; 10, <i>Atella</i>, Doubl.; 12, <i>Argynnis</i>,
Fabr.; 13, <i>Melitæa</i>,<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> Fabr.; 19, <i>Araschnia</i>, Hübn.;
22, <i>Vanessa</i>, Fabr.; 23, <i>Pyrameis</i>, Hübn.; 24,
<i>Junonia</i>, Hübn.; 31, <i>Ergolis</i>, Boisd.; 65, <i>Hypolimnas</i>,
Hübn. (<i>Diadema</i>, Boisd.); 77, <i>Limenitis</i>,
Fabr.; 81, <i>Neptis</i>, Fabr.; 82, <i>Athyma</i>, Westw.;
and finally with those of genus 90, <i>Euthalia</i>,
Hübn.&mdash;which, according to Horsfield’s figures,
possess only two rows of spines, these being remarkably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
long and curved, and fringing both sides.
It may be safely assumed that the intermediate
genera would agree in possessing this important
character of the Nymphalideous larvæ, viz., spines.</p>

<p>After the genus 90 there are 22 more genera,
and these are spineless, at least in the case of the
two chief genera, 93, <i>Apatura</i>, and 104, <i>Nymphalis</i>.
Of the remainder I know neither figures nor
<span class="locked">descriptions.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></span> In the two genera named the larvæ
are provided with two or more spine-like tentacles
on the head, and the last segment ends in a fork-like
process directed backwards. The body is
otherwise smooth, and differs also in form from
that of the larvæ of the other <i>Nymphalinæ</i>, being
thickest in the middle, and tapering anteriorly and
posteriorly; neither is the form cylindrical, but
somewhat flattened and slug-shaped. If therefore
we were to arrange these butterflies by the larvæ
instead of by the imagines, these two genera and
their allies would form a distinct family, and could
not remain associated with the 90 other Nymphalideous
genera.</p>

<p>We have here a case of <i>incongruence</i>; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
imagines of the genera 1&ndash;90 and 91&ndash;112 are
more closely allied than their larvæ.</p>

<p>From still another side there arises a similar
disagreement. The larvæ of the genera <i>Apatura</i>
and <i>Nymphalis</i> agree very closely in their bodily
form and in their forked caudal appendage with
the caterpillars of another sub-family of butterflies,
the <i>Satyrinæ</i>, whilst their imagines differ chiefly
from those of the latter sub-family in the absence
of an enlargement of certain veins of the fore-wings,
an essential character of the <i>Satyrinæ</i>.</p>

<p>This double disagreement has also been noticed
by those systematists who have taken the form of
the caterpillar into consideration. Thus, <span class="locked">Morris<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></span>
attempted to incorporate the genera <i>Apatura</i> and
<i>Nymphalis</i> into the family <i>Libytheidæ</i>, placing the
latter as transitional from the <i>Nymphalidæ</i> to the
<i>Satyridæ</i>. But although the imagines of the genera
<i>Apatura</i>, <i>Nymphalis</i>, and <i>Libythea</i> may be most
closely related&mdash;as I believe they actually are&mdash;the
larvæ are widely different, being at least as
different as are those of <i>Apatura</i> and <i>Nymphalis</i>
from the remaining <i>Nymphalinæ</i>.</p>

<p>Now if we could safely raise <i>Apatura</i> and
<i>Nymphalis</i> into a distinct family&mdash;an arrangement
which in the estimation of <span class="locked">Staudinger<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></span> is correct&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>and
if this were interpolated between the <i>Satyridæ</i>
and <i>Nymphalidæ</i>, such an arrangement could only
be based on the larval structure, and that of the
imagines would thus remain unconsidered, since
no other common characters can be found for these
two genera than those which they possess in
common with the other Nymphalideous genera.</p>

<p>The emperor-butterflies (<i>Apatura</i>), by the ocelli
of their fore-wings certainly put us somewhat in
mind of the <i>Satyrinæ</i>, in which such spots are
always present; but this character does not occur
in the genus <i>Nymphalis</i>, and is likewise absent in
most of the other genera of this group. The
genus <i>Apatura</i> shows in addition a most striking
similarity in the markings of the wings to the
purely Nymphalideous genus <i>Limenitis</i>, and it is
therefore placed, by those systematists who leave
this genus in the same family, in the closest
proximity to <i>Limenitis</i>. This resemblance cannot
depend upon mimicry, since not only one or
another but <i>all</i> the species of the two genera
possess a similar marking; and further, because
similarity of marking alone does not constitute
mimicry, but a resemblance in colour must also be
added. The genus <i>Limenitis</i> actually contains a
case of imitation, but in quite another direction;
this will be treated of subsequently.</p>

<p>It cannot therefore be well denied that in this
case the larvæ show different relationships to the
imagines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span></p>

<p>If the “natural” system is the expression of the
genetic relationship of living forms, the question
arises in this and in similar cases as to whether
the more credence is to be attached to the larvæ
or to the imagines&mdash;or, in more scientific phraseology,
which of the two inherited classes of characters
have been the most distinctly and completely
preserved, and which of these, through its form-relationship,
admits of the most distinct recognition
of the blood-relationship, or, inversely, which
has diverged the most widely from the ancestral
form? The decision in single instances cannot
but be difficult, and appears indeed at first sight
impossible; nevertheless this will be arrived at in
most cases as soon as the ontogeny of the larvæ,
and therewith a portion of the phylogeny of this
stage, can be accurately ascertained.</p>

<p>As in the <i>Rhopalocera</i> most of the families show
a complete congruence in the form-relationship of
the caterpillars and perfect insects, so a similar
congruence is also found in the majority of the
families belonging to other groups. Thus, the two
allied families of the group <i>Sphingina</i> can also be
very well characterized by their larvæ;<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> both the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
<i>Sphingidæ</i> and the <i>Sesiidæ</i> possess throughout a
characteristic form of larva.</p>

<p>Of the group <i>Bombycina</i> the family of the <i>Saturniidæ</i>
possess thick cylindrical caterpillars, of which
the segments are beset with a certain number of
knob-like warts. It is true that two genera of this
family (<i>Endromis</i> and <i>Aglia</i>) are without these
characteristic warts, but the imagines of these
genera also show extensive and common differences
from those of the other genera. A distinct family
has in fact already been based on these genera
(<i>Endromidæ</i>, Boisd.). Thus the congruence is
not thereby disturbed.</p>

<p>So also the families <i>Liparidæ</i>, <i>Euprepiidæ</i>, and
<i>Lithosiidæ</i> appear sharply defined in both forms;
and similar families occur likewise under the
<i>Noctuina</i>, although in this group the erection of
families presents great difficulties owing to the
near relationship of the genera, and is always to
some extent arbitrary. It is important, however,
that it is precisely the transitional families which
present intermediate forms both as larvæ and as
imagines.</p>

<p>Such an instance is offered by the <i>Acronyctidæ</i>,
a family belonging to the group <i>Noctuina</i>. The
imagines here show in certain points an approximation
to the group <i>Bombycina</i>; and their larvæ,
which are thickly covered with hairs, likewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
possess the characteristics of many of the caterpillars
of this <span class="locked">group.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></span></p>

<p>A second illustration is furnished by the family
<i>Ophiusidæ</i>, which is still placed by all systematists
under the <i>Noctuina</i>, its affinity to the <i>Geometrina</i>,
however, being represented by its being located at
the end of the <i>Noctuina</i>. The broad wings and
narrow bodies of these moths remind us in fact of
the appearance of the “geometers;” and the larvæ,
like the imagines, show a striking resemblance to
those of the <i>Geometrina</i> in the absence of the
anterior abdominal legs. For this reason Hübner
in his work on caterpillars has termed the species
of this family “<i>Semi-Geometræ</i>.”</p>

<p>All these cases show a complete congruence in
the two kinds of form-relationship; but exceptions
are not wanting. Thus, the family <i>Bombycidæ</i>
would certainly never have been formed if the
larval structure only had been taken into consideration,
since, whilst the genera <i>Gastropacha</i>,
<i>Clisiocampa</i>, <i>Lasiocampa</i>, <i>Odonestis</i>, and their
allies, are thickly covered with short silky hairs
disposed in a very characteristic manner, the caterpillars
of the genus <i>Bombyx</i>, to which the common
silkworm, <i>B. Mori</i>, belongs, are quite naked and
similar to many Sphinx-caterpillars (<i>Chærocampa</i>).
Are the imagines of the genera united under this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
family, at any rate morphologically, as unequally
related as their larvæ? Whether it is correct to
combine them into one family is a question that
does not belong here; we are now only concerned
with the fact that the two stages are related in form
in very different degrees.</p>

<p>An especially striking case of incongruence is
offered by the family <i>Notodontidæ</i>, under which
Boisduval, depending only on imaginal characters,
united genera of which the larvæ differed to a very
great extent. In O. Wilde’s work on caterpillars
this family is on this account quite correctly characterized
as follows:&mdash;“Larvæ of various forms,
naked or with thin hairs, sixteen or fourteen <span class="locked">legs.”<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></span>
In fact in the whole order Lepidoptera there can
scarcely be found associated together such diverse
larvæ as are here placed in one imago-family;
on one side the short cylindrical caterpillars of
the genus <i>Cnethocampa</i>, Steph. (<i>C. Processionea</i>,
<i>Pithyocampa</i>, &amp;c.), which are covered with fine,
brittle, hooked hairs, and are very similar to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
larvæ of <i>Gastropacha</i> with which they were formerly
united; and on the other side there are the
naked, humped, and flat-headed larvæ of the genus
<i>Harpyia</i>, Ochs., with their two long forked appendages
replacing the hindmost pair of legs, and
the grotesquely formed caterpillars of the genera
<i>Stauropus</i>, Germ., <i>Hybocampa</i>, Linn., and <i>Notodonta</i>,
Ochs.</p>

<p>The morphological congruence between larvæ
and imagines declares itself most sharply in genera,
where it is the rule almost without exception. In
this case we can indeed be sure that a genus or
sub-genus founded on the imagines only will, in
accordance with correct principles, present a corresponding
difference in the larvæ. Had the latter
been known first we should have been led to construct
the same genera as those which are now
established on the structure of the imagines, and
these, through other circumstances, would have
stood in the same degree of morphological relationship
as the genera founded on the imagines.
There is therefore a congruence in a double sense;
in the first place the differences between the larvæ
and imagines of any two genera are equally great,
and, in the next place, the common characters possessed
by these two stages combined cause them
to form precisely the same groups defined with
equal sharpness; the genera coincide completely.</p>

<p>So also the butterflies of the sub-family <i>Nymphalinæ</i>
can well be separated into genera by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
characters of the larvæ, and these, as far as I am
able to judge, would agree with the genera founded
on the imagines.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Melitæa</i>, for example, can be characterized
by the possession of 7&ndash;9 fleshy tubercles
bearing hairy spines; the genus <i>Argynnis</i> may be
distinguished by always having six hairy unbranched
spines on each segment, and the genus
<i>Cethosia</i> by two similar spines on each segment;
the genus <i>Vanessa</i> shows sometimes as many as
seven branched spines; and the genus <i>Limenitis</i>
never more than two branched blunt spines on
each segment, and so forth. If we go further into
details it will be seen that the most closely related
imagines, as might indeed have been expected,
likewise possess the most nearly allied larvæ, whilst
very small differences between the imagines are
also generally represented by corresponding differences
in the larvæ. Thus, for instance, the
genus <i>Vanessa</i> of Fabricius has been divided into
several genera by later authors. Of these sub-genera,
<i>Grapta</i>, Doubl. (containing the European
<i>C.-album</i>, the American <i>Fabricii</i>, <i>Interrogationis</i>,
<i>Faunus</i>, <i>Comma</i>, &amp;c.), is distinguished by the
fact that the larvæ not only possess branched spines
on all the segments with the exception of the prothorax,
but these spines are also present on the
head; in the genus <i>Vanessa</i> (<i>sensû strictiori</i>),
Doubl., the head and prothorax are spineless (<i>e.g.</i>
<i>V. Urticæ</i>); in the tropical genus <i>Junonia</i>, Hübn.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
which was also formerly (Godart, <span class="locked">1819<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></span>) united
with <i>Vanessa</i>, the larvæ bear branched spines on
all the segments, the head and prothorax included.</p>

<p>It is possible to go still further and to separate
two species of <i>Vanessa</i> as two new genera, although
they have hitherto been preserved from this fate
even by the systematists most given to “splitting.”
This decision is certainly justifiable, simply because
these species at present stand quite alone,
and the practical necessity of forming a distinct
genus does not make itself felt, and this practical
necessity moreover frequently comes into conflict
with scientific claims: science erects a new genus
based on the amount of morphological difference,
it being quite immaterial whether one or many
species make up this genus; such an excessive
subdivision is, however, a hindrance to practical
requirements, as the cumbrous array of names
thereby becomes still further augmented.</p>

<p>The two species which I might separate from
<i>Vanessa</i> on the ground of their greater divergence,
are the very common and widely distributed <i>V.
Io</i> and <i>Antiopa</i>, the Peacock Butterfly and the
Camberwell Beauty. In the very remarkable
pattern of their wings, both show most marked
characteristics; <i>Io</i> possesses a large ocellus on
each wing, and <i>Antiopa</i> has a broad light yellow
border which is not found in any other species of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
<i>Vanessa</i>. There can be no doubt but that each
of these would have been long ago raised into a
genus if similarly marked species of <i>Vanessa</i>
occurred in other parts of the world, as is the case
with the other species of the genus. Thus, it is
well known that there is a whole series of species
resembling our <i>V. Cardui</i>, and another series resembling
our <i>V. C.-album</i>, the two series possessing
the same respective types of marking;
indeed on these grounds the sub-genera <i>Pyrameis</i>
and <i>Grapta</i> have been <span class="locked">erected.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></span></p>

<p>I should not have considered it worth while to
have made these remarks if it had not been for the
fact that the caterpillars of <i>V. Io</i> and <i>V. Antiopa</i>
differ in small particulars from one another and
from the other species of the genus. These differences
relate to the number and position of the
spines, as can be seen from the following <span class="locked">table:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>This character of the number of spines will not
be considered as too unimportant when we observe
how perfectly constant it remains in the nearly
allied species. This is the case in the three consecutive
forms, <i>Urticæ</i>, <i>Polychloros</i>, and <i>Ichnusa</i>.
Now when we see that two species which differ in
their imaginal characters present correspondingly
small differences in their larvæ, this exact systematic
congruence indicates a completely parallel
phyletic development.</p>

<p>Exceptions are, however, to be met with here.
Thus, Hübner has united one group of the species<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
of <i>Vanessa</i> into the genus <i>Pyrameis</i> just mentioned,
on account of certain characteristic distinctions of
the butterflies. I do not know, however, how this
genus admits of being grounded on the structure
of the larvæ; the latter, as appears from the
above table, agree exactly in the number and
position of the spines with the caterpillars of
<i>Vanessa</i> (<i>sensû strictiori</i>), nor can any common
form of marking be detected which would enable
them to be separated from <i>Vanessa</i>.</p>

<p>Still more striking is the incongruence in the
genus <i>Araschnia</i>, Hübn. (<i>A. Prorsa-Levana</i>),
which, like the genus <i>Pyrameis</i>, is entirely based
on imaginal characters. This is distinguished
from all the other sub-genera of the old genus
<i>Vanessa</i> by a small difference in the venation of
the wings (the discoidal cell of the hind-wings is
open instead of closed). Now it is well-known
that in butterflies the wing-venation, as most correctly
shown by Herrich-Schäffer, is the safest
criterion of “relationship.” It thus happens that
this genus, typified by the common <i>Levana</i>, is in
Kirby’s Catalogue separated from <i>Vanessa</i> by two
genera, and according to Herrich-Schäffer<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> by
forty genera! Nevertheless, the larvæ agree so
exactly in their spinal formula with <i>Grapta</i> that
we should have no hesitation in regarding them
as a species of this sub-genus. It appears to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
very probable that in this case the form-relationship
of the caterpillar gives more correct information
as to the blood-relationship of the species
than that of the imago&mdash;in any case the larvæ
show a different form-relationship to the imagines.</p>

<p>Just as in the case of butterflies there are
many genera of <i>Sphingidæ</i> which can be based on
the structure of the larvæ, and which agree with
those founded on the imagines.</p>

<p>Thus, the genus <i>Macroglossa</i> is characterized
by a straight anal horn, a spherical head, and by a
marking composed of longitudinal stripes, these
characters not occurring elsewhere in this combination.
The nearly allied genus <i>Pterogon</i>, on
the other hand, cannot be based on the larvæ
only, since not only is the marking of the adult
larva very distinct in the different species, but the
anal horn is present in two species, whilst in a
third (<i>P. Œnotheræ</i>) it is replaced by a knob-like
eye-spot. The genus <i>Sphinx</i> (<i>sensû strictiori</i>) is
distinguished by the simple, curved caudal horn,
the smooth, egg-shaped head and smooth skin, and
by a marking mainly composed of seven oblique
stripes. The genus <i>Deilephila</i> is distinguished
from the preceding by a dorsal plate, situated on
the prothorax and interrupting the marking, as
well as by the pattern, which here consists of a
subdorsal line with ring-spots more or less
numerous and developed; the skin also is rough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
“shagreened,” although it must be admitted that
there are exceptions (<i>Vespertilio</i>). The genus
<i>Chærocampa</i> admits also of being based on the
form-relationship of its caterpillars, although this
is certainly only possible by disregarding the
marking and taking alone into consideration the
peculiar pig-like form of the larvæ. The genus
<i>Acherontia</i>, so nearly related to <i>Sphinx</i>, possesses
in the doubly curved caudal horn a character
common to the genus (three species <span class="locked">known<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></span>).
Finally may be mentioned the genus <i>Smerinthus</i>,
of which the larvæ, by their anteriorly tapering
form, their shagreened skin and almost triangular
head with the apex upwards, their simply curved
anal horn, and by their seven oblique stripes on
each side, constitute a genus as sharply defined as
that formed by the moths.</p>

<p>Although in all the systematic divisions hitherto
treated of there are cases where the form-relationship
of the larva does not completely coincide
with that of the imago, such incongruences are of
far more frequent occurrence in the smallest systematic
group, viz. species.</p>

<p>The larvæ of two species have very frequently
a much nearer form-relationship than their imagines.
Thus, the caterpillars of <i>Smerinthus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>
Ocellatus</i> and <i>S. Populi</i> are closely allied in structure,
marking, and colouring, whilst the moths in
these two last characters and in the form of the
wings are widely <span class="locked">separated.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></span> Judging from the
larvæ we should expect to obtain two very similar
moths, but in fact both <i>Populi</i> and <i>Ocellatus</i> have
many near allies, and these closely related species
sometimes possess larvæ which differ more
widely than those of more distantly related species
of imagines.</p>

<p>Thus, in Amur-land and North America there
occur species of <i>Smerinthus</i> which closely resemble
our <i>Ocellatus</i> in colour, marking, and form of
wing, and which possess the characteristic large
blue ocellus on the hind-wings. <i>S. Excæcatus</i> is
quite correctly regarded as the representative
American form of our <i>Ocellatus</i>, but its caterpillar,
instead of being leaf-green, is of a chrome-yellow,
and possesses dark green instead of white oblique
stripes, and has moreover a number of red spots,
and a red band on the head&mdash;in brief, in the very
characters (colour and certain of the markings) in
which the imagines completely agree it is widely
different from <i>Ocellatus</i>. It appears also to be
covered with short bristles, judging from Abbot
and Smith’s <span class="locked">figure.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a></span></p>

<p>Just in the same way that the species having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
the nearest conceivable form-relationship to
<i>Ocellatus</i> possesses a relatively strongly diverging
larva, so does the nearest form-relation of
<i>Populi</i> (imago) offer a parallel case. This species,
which is also North American, lives on <i>Juglans
Alba</i>. The imago of <i>Smerinthus Juglandis</i>
differs considerably from <i>S. Populi</i> in the form of
the wings, but it resembles the European species
so closely in marking and colouring that no doubt
can exist as to the near relationship of the two
forms. The caterpillar of <i>S. Juglandis</i>,<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> however,
differs to a great extent from that of <i>Populi</i>
in colour&mdash;it is not possible to confound these two
larvæ; but those of <i>Populi</i> and <i>Ocellatus</i> are not
only easily mistaken for one another, but are distinguished
with difficulty even by experts.</p>

<p>In this same family of the <i>Sphingidæ</i> cases are
not wanting in which, on the other hand, the
moths are far more closely allied than the larvæ.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
This is especially striking in the genus <i>Deilephila</i>,
eight species of which are allied in the imaginal
state in a remarkable degree, whilst the larvæ
differ greatly from one another in colour, and to
as great an extent in marking. These eight
species are <i>D. Nicæa</i>, <i>Euphorbiæ</i>, <i>Dahlii</i>, <i>Galii</i>,
<i>Livornica</i>, <i>Lineata</i>, <i>Zygophylli</i>, and <i>Hippophaës</i>.
Of these, <i>Nicæa</i>, <i>Euphorbiæ</i>, <i>Dahlii</i>, <i>Zygophylli</i>,
and <i>Hippophaës</i> are so much alike in their whole
structure, in the form of the wings, and in marking,
that few entomologists can correctly identify
them off-hand without comparison. The larvæ
of these four species, however, are of very different
appearances. Those of <i>Euphorbiæ</i> and <i>Dahlii</i>
are most alike, both being distinguished by the
possession of a double row of large ring-spots.
<i>Zygophylli</i> (see Fig. 50, <a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI</a>.) possesses only faint
indications of ring-spots on a white subdorsal line;
and in <i>Hippophaës</i> there is only an orange-red
spot on the eleventh segment, the entire marking
consisting of a subdorsal line on which, in some
individuals, there are situated more or less developed
ring-spots (see Figs. 59 and 60, <a href="#Plate_VII">Pl. VII</a>.).
If we only compare the larvæ and imagines of <i>D.
Euphorbiæ</i> and <i>Hippophaës</i>, we cannot but be
struck with astonishment at the great difference of
form-relationship in the two stages of development.</p>

<p>In the case of <i>D. Euphorbiæ</i> and <i>Nicæa</i> this
difference is almost greater. Whilst these larvæ
show great differences in colour, marking, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
the roughness or smoothness of the skin (compare
Fig. 51, <a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI</a>. with Figs. 43 and 44, <a href="#Plate_V">Pl. V</a>.), the
moths cannot be distinguished with certainty. As
has already been stated, the imago of the rare <i>D.
Nicæa</i> is for this reason wanting in most collections;
it cannot be detected whether a specimen
is genuine, <i>i.e.</i> whether it may not perhaps be a
somewhat large example of <i>D. Euphorbiæ</i>.</p>

<p>An especially striking instance of incongruence
is offered by the two species of <i>Chærocampa</i> most
common with us, viz., <i>Elpenor</i> and <i>Porcellus</i>, the
large and small Elephant Hawk-moths. The
larvæ are so similar, even in the smallest details of
marking, that they could scarcely be identified
with certainty were it not that one species
(<i>Elpenor</i>) is considerably larger and possesses a
less curved caudal horn than the other. The
moths of these two species much resemble one
another in their dull green and red colours, but
differ in the arrangement of these colours, <i>i.e.</i> in
marking, and also in the form of their wings, to
such an extent that <i>Porcellus</i> has been referred to
the genus <i>Pergesa</i><a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> of Walker. If systemy, as is
admitted on many sides, has only to indicate the
morphological relationship, this author is not to
blame&mdash;but in this case a special larval classification
must likewise be admitted, in a manner
somewhat similar to that at present adopted
provisionally in text-books of zoology for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
Hydroid Polypes and inferior Medusæ. This
case of <i>Porcellus</i>, however, shows that those are
correct who maintain that systemy claims to
express, although incompletely, the blood-relationship,
and that systematists have always unconsciously
formed their groups as though they
intended to express the genetic connection of the
forms. Only on this supposition can it appear
incorrect to us to thus separate two species of
which the larvæ agree so completely.</p>

<p>I cannot conclude this review of the various
systematic groups without taking a glance at the
groups comprised within species, viz. varieties.
Whilst in species incongruence is of frequent
occurrence, in varieties this is the rule, for which
reason it admits in this case of being more
sharply defined, since we are not concerned with
a double difference but only with the question
whether in the one stage a difference or an
absolute similarity is observable. By far the
majority of varieties are either simply imaginal or
merely larval varieties&mdash;only the one stage
diverges, the other is quite constant.</p>

<p>Thus, as has already been shown, in all the
seasonally dimorphic butterflies known to me the
caterpillars of the two generations of imagines,
which are often so widely different, are exactly
alike; and the same obtains for the majority of
purely climatic varieties of butterflies. Unfortunately
there are as yet no connected observations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
on this point. The only certain instance
that I can here mention is that of the Alpine and
Polar form of <i>Pteris Napi</i>. This variety, <i>Bryoniæ</i>,
the female of which differs so greatly in marking
and colouring, possesses larvæ which cannot be
distinguished from those of the ordinary form of
<i>Napi</i>.(See part I. appendix I. p. <a href="#Page_124">124</a>.)</p>

<p>That caterpillars can also vary locally without
thereby affecting the imagines is shown by the
frequently mentioned and closely investigated cases
of di- and polymorphism in the larvæ of a number
of <i>Sphingidæ</i> (<i>M. Stellatarum</i>, <i>A. Atropos</i>, <i>S.
Convolvuli</i>, <i>C. Elpenor</i>, and <i>Porcellus</i>, &amp;c.). The
same thing is still more clearly shown by those
instances in which there are not several but only
one distinct larval form occurring in each of two
different localities.</p>

<p>To this class belongs the above-mentioned case
of <i>Chærocampa Celerio</i> (p. <a href="#Page_197">197</a>), supposing our
information concerning this species to be correct;
likewise the recently-mentioned case of the
Ligurian variety of the caterpillar of <i>Saturnia
Carpini</i>; and finally the case of <i>Eriogaster Lanestris</i>,
so well known to lepidopterists. This
insect inhabits the plains of Germany, and in the
Alps extends to an elevation of 7000 feet, where it
possesses a larva differently marked and coloured
(<i>E. Arbusculæ</i>) to those of the lowlands whilst the
moths are smaller, but do not differ in other respects
from those of the plains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span></p>

<p>Among the Alpine species many other such
cases may occur, but these could only be discovered
by making investigations having special
reference to this point. Of the Alpine butterflies,
for example, not a single species can have been
reared from the caterpillar; for this reason but few
observations have on the whole been given by
entomologists respecting the Alpine larvæ, which
are not known sufficiently well to enable such a
question to be decided.</p>

<p>The investigation of the form-relationships
existing between larvæ on the one hand and
imagines on the other has thus led to the following
<span class="locked">results:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>We learn on comparison that incongruences or
inequalities of form-relationship occur in all systematic
groups from varieties to families. These
incongruences are of two kinds, in some cases
being disclosed by the fact that the larvæ of two
systematic groups, <i>e.g.</i> two species, are more
closely related in form than their imagines (or
inversely), whilst in other cases the larvæ form
different systematic groups to those formed by the
imagines.</p>

<p>The results of the investigation into the occurrence
of incongruences among the various systematic
groups may be thus briefly <span class="locked">summarised:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Incongruences appear to occur most frequently
among varieties, since it very frequently happens
that it is only the larva or only the imago which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span>
has diverged into a variety, the other stage remaining
monomorphic. The systematic division
of varieties is thus very often one-sided.</p>

<p>Among species also incongruences are of frequent
occurrence. Sometimes the imagines are
much more nearly related in form than the larvæ,
and at others the reverse happens; whilst again the
case appears also to occur in which only the one
stage (larva) diverges to the extent of specific
difference, the other stage remaining monomorphic
(<i>D. Euphorbiæ</i> and <i>Nicæa</i>).</p>

<p>The agreement in form-relationship appears to
be most complete in genera. In the greater number
of cases the larval and imaginal genera coincide,
not only in the sharpness of their limits, but
also&mdash;as far as one can judge&mdash;in the weight of
their distinctive characters, and therefore in the
amount of their divergence. Of all the systematic
groups, genera show the greatest congruence.</p>

<p>In families there is again an increase of irregularity.
Although larval and imaginal families
generally agree, there are so many exceptions that
the groups would be smaller if they were based
exclusively on the larval structure than if founded
entirely on the imagines (<i>Nymphalidæ</i>, <i>Bombycidæ</i>).</p>

<p>If we turn to the groups of families we find a
considerably increased incongruence; complete
agreement is here again rather the exception, and
it further happens in these cases that it is always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>
the larvæ which, to a certain extent, remain at a
lower grade, and which form well defined families;
but these can seldom be associated into groups of
a higher order having a common character, as in
the case of the imagines (<i>Rhopalocera</i>).</p>

<p>After having thus collected (so far as I am able)
the facts, we have now to attempt their interpretation,
and from the observed congruence and incongruence
of form-relationship of the two stages to
endeavour to draw a conclusion as to the underlying
causes of the transformations.</p>

<p>It is clear at starting that all cases of incongruence
can only be the expression or the consequence
of a phyletic development which has not been
exactly parallel in the two stages of larva and
imago&mdash;that one stage must have changed either
more rapidly or more slowly than the other. An
“unequal phyletic development” is thus the immediate
cause of incongruence.</p>

<p>Thus, the occurrence of different larvæ in species
of which the imagines have remained alike may be
simply understood as cases in which the imago
only has experienced a change&mdash;has taken a forward
step in phyletic development, whilst the larvæ have
remained behind. If we conceive this one-sided
development to be repeated several times, there
would arise two larval forms as widely different as
those of <i>Deilephila Nicæa</i>, and <i>Euphorbiæ</i>, whilst
the imagines, as is actually the case in these
species, would remain the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span></p>

<p>The more commonly occurring case in which
one stage has a greater form-divergence than the
other, is explicable by the one stage having changed
more frequently or more strongly than the other.</p>

<p>The explanation of the phenomena thus far
lies on the surface, and it is scarcely possible to
advance any other; but why should one stage
become changed more frequently or to a greater
extent than the other? why should one portion
be induced to change more frequently or more
strongly than another? whence come these inducements
to change? These questions bring us
to the main point of inquiry:&mdash;Are the causes
which give rise to these changes internal or external?
Are the latter the result of a phyletic
vital force, or are they only due to the action of
the external conditions of life?</p>

<p>Although an answer to this question will be
found in the preceding essay, I will not support
myself on the results there obtained, but will endeavour
to give another solution of the problem
on fresh grounds. The answer will indeed be the
same as before:&mdash;A phyletic force must be discountenanced,
since in the first place it does not
explain the phenomena, and in the second place
the phenomena can be well explained without its
assumption.</p>

<p>The admission of a phyletic vital force does not
explain the phenomena. The assumption that
there is a transforming power innate in the organism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
indeed agrees quite well with the phenomenon
of congruence, but not with that of incongruence.
Since a large number of cases of the latter depend
upon the fact that the larvæ are more frequently
influenced by causes of change than their imagines,
or <i>vice versâ</i>, how can this be reconciled with such
an internal force? On this assumption would not
each stage of a species be compelled to change, if
not contemporaneously at least successively, with
the same frequency and intensity, by the action of
an innate force? and how by means of the latter
can there ever result a greater form-divergence in
the larvæ than in the imagines?</p>

<p>It is delusive to believe that these unequal
deviations can be explained by assuming that the
phyletic force acts periodically. Granting that it
does so, and that the internal power successively
compels the imago, pupa, and finally the larva to
change, there would then pass a kind of wave of
transformation over the different stages of the
species, as was actually shown above to be the case
in the single larval stages. The only possible way
of explaining the unequal distances between larvæ
and imagines would therefore be to assume that
two allied groups, <i>e.g.</i> species, were not contemporaneously
affected by the wave, so that at a certain
period of time the imago alone of one species
had become changed, whilst in the other species
the wave of transformation had also reached the
larva. In this case the imagines of the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>
species would thus appear to be more nearly related
than their larvæ.</p>

<p>Now this strained explanation is eminently inapplicable
to varieties, still less to species, and
least of all to higher systematic groups, for the
simple reason that every wave of transformation
may be assumed to be at the most of such strength
as to produce a deviation of form equal to that of
a variety. Were the change resulting from a single
disturbance greater, we should not only find
one-sided varieties, <i>i.e.</i> those belonging to <i>one</i>
stage, but we should also meet as frequently with
one-sided species. If, however, a wave of transformation
can only produce a variety even in the
case of greatest form-divergence, the above hypothetical
uncontemporaneous action of such a wave
in two species could only give rise to such small
differences in the two stages that we could but
designate them as varieties. An accumulation of
the results of the action of several successive
waves passing over the same species could not
happen, because the distance from a neighbouring
species would always become the same in two
stages as soon as <i>one</i> wave had ended its course.
In this manner there could therefore only arise
divergences of the value of varieties, and incongruences
in systematic groups of a higher rank
could not thus be explained.</p>

<p>All explanations of the second form of incongruence
from the point of view of a phyletic force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
can also be shown to be absurd. How can the
fact be explained that larval and imaginal families
by no means always coincide; or that the larvæ
can only be formed into families whilst the
imagines partly form sharply defined groups of a
higher order? How can an internal directive
force within the same organism urge in two quite
distinct directions? If the evolution of a definite
system were designed, and the admission of such
a continually acting power rendered necessary,
why such an incomplete, uncertain, and confused
performance?</p>

<p>I must leave others to answer these questions;
to me a vital force appears to be inadmissible, not
only because we cannot understand the phenomena
by its aid, but above all because it is superfluous
for their explanation. In accordance with general
principles the assumption of an unknown force
can, however, only be made when it is indispensable
to the comprehension of the phenomena.</p>

<p>I believe that the phenomena can be quite well
understood without any such assumption&mdash;both
the phenomena of congruence and incongruence,
in their two forms of unequal divergence and
unequal group-formation.</p>

<p>Let us in the first place admit that there is no
directive force in the organism inciting periodic
change, but that every change is always the consequence
of external conditions, being ultimately
nothing but the reaction&mdash;the response of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>
organism to some of the influences proceeding
from the environment; every living form would
in this case remain constant so long as it was not
compelled to change by inciting causes. Such
transforming factors can act directly or indirectly,
<i>i.e.</i> they can produce new changes immediately,
or can bring about a remodelling by the combination,
accumulation, or suppression of individual
variations already present (adaptation by natural
selection). Both forms of this action of external
influences have long been shown to be in actual
operation, so that no new assumption will be made,
but only an attempt to explain the phenomena in
question by the sole action of these known factors
of species formation.</p>

<p>If, in the first instance, we fix our attention
upon that form of incongruence which manifests
itself through unequal divergence of form-relationship,
it will appear prominently that this bears
precise relations to the different systematic groups.
This form of incongruence constitutes the rule in
varieties of the order Lepidoptera, it is of very
frequent occurrence in species, but disappears
almost completely in genera, and entirely in the
case of families and the higher groups. On the
whole, therefore, as we turn to more and more
comprehensive groups, the incongruence diminishes
whilst the congruence increases, until finally the
latter becomes the rule.</p>

<p>Now if congruence presupposes an equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>
number of transforming impulses, we perceive
that the number of the impulses which have
affected larvæ and imagines agree with one
another the more closely the larger the systematic
groups which are compared together. How can
this be otherwise? The larger the systematic
group the longer the period of time which must
have been necessary for its formation, and the
more numerous the transforming impulses which
must have acted upon it before its formation was
completed.</p>

<p>But if the supposition that the impulse to
change always comes from the environment in no
way favours the idea that such impulses always
affect both stages contemporaneously, and are
equal in number during the same period of time,
there is not, on the other hand, the least ground
for assuming that throughout long periods the
larvæ or the imagines only would have been
affected by such transforming influences. This
could have been inferred from the fact that
varieties frequently depend only upon one stage,
whilst specific differences in larvæ only also occur
occasionally, the imagines remaining alike; but no
single genus is known of which all the species
possess similar larvæ. Within the period of time
during which genera can be formed the transforming
impulses therefore never actually affect
the one stage only, but always influence both.</p>

<p>But if this is the case&mdash;if within the period of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
time which is sufficient for the production of
species, the one stage only is but seldom and quite
exceptionally influenced by transforming impulses,
whilst both stages are as a rule affected, although
not with the same frequency, it must necessarily
follow that on the whole, as the period of time
increases, the difference in the number of these
impulses which affect the larva and of those
which affect the imago must continually decrease,
and with this difference the magnitude of the
morphological differences resulting from the transforming
influences must at the same time also
diminish. With the number of the successively
increasing changes the difference in the magnitude
of the change in the two stages would always
relatively diminish until it had quite vanished
from our perception; just in the same manner as
we can distinguish a group of three grains of corn
from one composed of six, but not a heap of 103
grains from one containing 106 grains.</p>

<p>That the small systematic groups must have
required a short period and the large groups a
long period of time for their formation requires no
special proof, but results immediately from the
theory of descent.</p>

<p>All the foregoing considerations would, however,
only hold good if the transforming impulses
were equal in strength, or, not to speak figuratively,
if the changes only occurred in equivalent
portions of the body, <i>i.e.</i> in such portions as those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
in which the changes are of the same physiological
and morphological importance to the whole
organism.</p>

<p>Now in the lower systematic groups this is
always the case. Varieties, species, and genera
are always distinguished by only relatively small
differences; deep-seated distinctions do not here
occur, as is implied in the conception of these
categories. The true cause of this is, I believe,
to be found in the circumstance that all changes
take place only by the smallest steps, so that
greater differences can only arise in the course of
longer periods of time, within which a great
number of types (species) can, however, come
into existence, and these would be related by
blood and in form in different degrees, and would
therefore form a systematic group of a higher
rank.</p>

<p>The short periods necessary for the production
of inferior groups, such as genera, would not
result in incongruences if only <i>un</i>typical parts of
the larvæ, such as marking or spines, underwent
change, whilst in the imagines typical parts&mdash;wings
and legs&mdash;became transformed. The
changes which could have occurred in the wings,
&amp;c., during this period of time would have been
much too small to produce any considerable influence
on the other parts of the body by correlation;
and two species of which the larvæ and imagines,
had changed with the same frequency, would show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span>
a similar amount of divergence between the larvæ
and between the imagines, although on the one
side only <i>un</i>typical parts&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> those of no importance
to the whole organization&mdash;and on the
other side typical parts, were affected. The
<i>number</i> of the changes would here alone determine
whether congruence or incongruence occurred
between the two stages.</p>

<p>The case would be quite different if, throughout
a long period of time, in the one stage only
typical and in the other only untypical parts were
subjected to change. In the first case a complete
transformation of the whole structure would occur,
since not only would the typical parts, such as the
wings, undergo a much further and increasing
transformation in the same direction, but these
changes would also lead to secondary alterations.</p>

<p>In this manner, I believe, must be explained
the fact that in the higher groups still greater
form-divergences of the two stages occur; and if
this explanation is correct, the cause of this striking
phenomenon, viz., that incongruence diminishes
from varieties to genera, in which latter it occurs
but exceptionally, whilst in families and in the
higher groups it again continually increases, is
likewise revealed. Up to genera the incongruence
depends entirely upon the one stage having
become changed <i>more frequently</i> than the other;
but in families and groups of families, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span>
orders Diptera and Hymenoptera, as will be shown
subsequently, in sub-orders and tribes, it depends
upon the <i>importance of the part of the body</i> affected
by the predominant change. In the latter case
the number of changes is of no importance,
because these are so numerous that the difference
vanishes from our perception; but an equal
number of changes, even when very great, may
now produce a much greater or a much smaller
transformation in the entire bodily structure
according as they affect typical or untypical portions,
or according as they keep in the same
direction throughout a long period of time, or
change their direction frequently.</p>

<p>Those unequal form-divergences which occur in
the higher systematic groups a re always associated
with a different formation of groups&mdash;the larvæ
form different systematic groups to the imagines,
so that one of these stages constitutes a higher or
a lower group; or else the groups are of equal
importance in the two stages, but are of unequal
magnitude&mdash;they do not coincide, but the one
overlaps the other.</p>

<p>Incongruences of this last kind appear in certain
cases within families (<i>Nymphalidæ</i>), but I will not
now subject these to closer analysis, because their
causes will appear more clearly when subsequently
considering the orders Hymenoptera and Diptera.
Incongruences of the first kind, however, admit
of a clear explanation in the case of butterflies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>
They appear most distinctly in the groups composed
of families.</p>

<p>Nobody has as yet been able to establish the
group <i>Rhopalocera</i> by means of any single character
common to the larvæ; nevertheless, this
group in the imagines is the sharpest and best
defined of the whole order. If we inform the
merest tyro that clubbed antennæ are the chief
character of the butterflies, he will never hesitate
in assigning one of these insects to its correct
group. Such a typical character, common to all
families, is, however, absent in the larvæ; and it
might be correctly said that there were no Rhopalocerous
larvæ, or rather that there were only
larvæ of <i>Equites</i>, <i>Nymphales</i>, and <i>Heliconii</i>. The
larvæ of the various families can be readily separated
by means of characteristic distinctions, and
it would not be difficult for an adept to distinguish
to this extent in single cases a Rhopalocerous
caterpillar as such; but these larvæ possess only
<i>family</i> characters, and not those of a higher
order.</p>

<p>This incongruence partly depends upon the circumstance
that the form-divergence between a
Rhopalocerous and a Heterocerous family is much
greater on the side of the imagines than on that of
the larvæ. Were there but a single family of
butterflies in existence, such as the <i>Equites</i>, we
should be obliged to elevate this to the rank of
a sub-order on the side of the imagines, but not on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
that of the larvæ. Such cases actually occur, and
an instance of this kind will be mentioned later in
connection with the Diptera. But this alone does
not explain why, on the side of the imagines, a
whole series of families show the same amount of
morphological divergence from the families of
other groups. There are two things, therefore,
which must here be explained:&mdash;First, why is the
form-divergence between the imagines of the
Rhopalocera and Heterocera greater than that
between their larvæ? and, secondly, why can
the imagines of the Rhopalocera be formed into
one large group by means of common characters
whilst the larvæ cannot?</p>

<p>The answers to both these questions can easily
be given from our present standpoint. As far as
the first question is concerned, this finds its solution
in the fact that the form-divergence always
corresponds exactly with the divergence of function,
<i>i.e.</i> with the divergence in the mode of life.</p>

<p>If we compare a butterfly with a moth there
can be no doubt that the difference in the conditions
of life is far greater on the side of the
imagines than on that of the larvæ. The differences
in the mode of life of the larvæ are on the
whole but very small. They are all vegetable
feeders, requiring large quantities of food, and can
only cease feeding during a short time, for which
reason they never leave their food-plants for long,
and it is of more importance for them to remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span>
firmly attached than to be able to run rapidly. It
is unnecessary for them to seek long for their food,
as they generally find themselves amidst an abundance,
and upon this depends the small development
of their eyes and other organs of sense. On
the whole caterpillars live under very uniform
conditions, although these may vary in manifold
details.</p>

<p>The greatest difference in the mode of life
which occurs amongst Lepidopterous larvæ is
shown by wood feeders. But even these, which
by their constant exclusion from light, the hardness
of their food, their confinement within narrow
hard-walled galleries, and by the peculiar kind of
movement necessitated by these galleries, are so
differently situated in many particulars to those
larvæ which live openly on plants, have not experienced
any general change in the typical conformation
of the body by adaptation to these conditions
of life. These larvæ, which, as has already
been mentioned, belong to the most diverse
families, are more or less colourless and flattened,
and have very strong jaws and small feet; but in
none of them do we find a smaller number of
segments, or any disappearance, or important
transformation of the typical limbs; they all without
exception possess sixteen legs, like the other
larvæ excepting the <i>Geometræ</i>.</p>

<p>Now if even under the most widely diverging
conditions of life adaptation of form is produced by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span>
relatively small, and to a certain extent superficial,
changes, we should expect less typical transformations
in the great majority of caterpillars which
live on the exterior of plants or in their softer
parts (most of the Micro-lepidoptera). The great
diversity in the forms of caterpillars depends
essentially upon a different formation of the skin
and its underlying portions. The skin is sometimes
naked, and can then acquire the most diverse
colours, either protective or conspicuous, or it may
develop offensive or defensive markings; in other
cases it may be covered with hairs which sting,
or with spines which prick; certain of its glands
may develop to an enormous size, and acquire
brilliant colours and the power of emitting stinking
secretions (the tentacles of the <i>Papilionidæ</i> and
Cuspidate larvæ); by the development of warts,
angles, humps, &amp;c., any species of caterpillar may
be invested with the most grotesque shape, the
significance of which with respect to the life of the
insect is as yet in most cases by no means clear:
<i>typical portions</i> are not, however, essentially
influenced by these manifold variations. At most
only the form of the individual segments of the
body, and with these the shape of the whole insect,
become changed (onisciform larvæ of <i>Lycænidæ</i>),
but a segment is never suppressed, and even any
considerable lengthening of the legs occurs but
very seldom (<i>Stauropus Fagi</i>).<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span></p>

<p>We may therefore fairly assert that the structure
of larvæ is on the whole remarkably uniform, in
consequence of the uniformity in the conditions of
life. Notwithstanding the great variety of external
aspects, the general structure of caterpillars
does not become changed&mdash;it is only their outward
garb which varies, sometimes in one direction, and
sometimes in another, and which, starting from
inherited characters, becomes adapted to the
various special conditions of life in the best possible
manner.</p>

<p>All this is quite different in the case of the
imagines, where we meet with very important
differences in the conditions of life. The butterflies,
which live under the influence of direct sunlight
and a much higher temperature, and which
are on the wing for a much longer period during
the day, must evidently be differently equipped to
the moths in their motor organs (wings), degree
of hairiness, and in the development of their eyes
and other organs of sense. It is true that we are
not at present in a condition to furnish special
proofs that the individual organs of butterflies are
exactly adapted to a diurnal life, but we may
safely draw this general conclusion from the circumstance
that no butterfly is of nocturnal <span class="locked">habits.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span>
It cannot be stated in objection that there are
many moths which fly by day. It certainly
appears that no great structural change is necessary
to confer upon a Lepidopteron organized for nocturnal
life the power of also flying by day; but
this proves nothing against the view that the
structure of the butterflies depends upon adaptation
to a diurnal life. Analogous cases are
known to occur in many other groups of animals.
Thus, the decapodous Crustacea are obviously
organized for an aquatic life; but there are some
crabs which take long journeys by land. Fish
appear no less to be exclusively adapted to live in
water; nevertheless the “climbing-perch” (<i>Anabas</i>)
can live for hours on land.</p>

<p>It is not the circumstance that some of the
moths fly by day which is extraordinary and
demands a special explanation, but the reverse
fact just mentioned, that no known butterfly flies
by night. We may conclude from this that the
organization of the latter is not adapted to a
nocturnal life.</p>

<p>If we <span class="locked">assume<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a></span> that the Lepidopterous family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span>
adapted to a diurnal life gives rise in the course of
time to a nocturnal family, there can be no doubt
but that the transformation of structure would be
far greater on the part of the imagines than on that
of the larvæ. The latter would not remain quite
unchanged&mdash;not because their imagines had taken
to a nocturnal life which for the larva would be
quite immaterial, but because this change could
only occur very gradually in the course of a large
number of generations, and during this long period
the conditions of life would necessarily often change
with respect to the larvæ. It has been shown
above that within the period of time necessary for
the formation of a new species impulses to change
occur on both sides; how much more numerous
therefore must these be in the case of a group of
much higher rank, for the establishment of which
a considerably longer period is required. In the
case assumed, therefore, the larvæ would also
change, but they would suffer much smaller transformations
than the imagines. Whilst in the
latter almost all the typical portions of the body
would undergo deep changes in consequence of the
entirely different conditions of life, the larvæ would
perhaps only change in marking, hairs, bristles, or
other external characters, the typical parts experiencing
only unimportant modifications.</p>

<p>In this manner it can easily be understood why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">478</a></span>
the larvæ of a family of <i>Noctuæ</i> do not differ to
a greater extent from those of a family of butterflies
than do the latter from some other Rhopalocerous
family, or why the imagines of a Rhopalocerous and
a Heterocerous family present much greater form-divergences
than their larvæ. At the same time
is therefore explained the unequal value that must
be attributed to any single family of butterflies in
its larvæ and in its imagines. The unequal form-divergences
coincide exactly with the inequalities
in the conditions of life.</p>

<p>When whole families of butterflies show the same
structure in their typical parts (antennæ, wings,
&amp;c.), and, what is of more importance, can be
separated as a systematic group of a higher order
(<i>i.e.</i> as a section or sub-order) from the other
Lepidoptera whilst their larval families do not
appear to be connected by any common character,
the cause of this incongruence lies simply in the
circumstance that the imagines live under some
peculiar conditions which are common to them all,
but which do not recur in other Lepidopterous
groups. Their larvæ live in precisely the same
manner as those of all the other families of Lepidoptera&mdash;they
do not differ in their mode of life
from those of the Heterocerous families to a greater
extent than they do from one another.</p>

<p>We therefore see here a community of form
within the same compass as that in which there is
community in the conditions of life. In all butterflies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span>
such community is found in their diurnal habits,
and in accordance with this we find that these only,
and not their larvæ, can be formed into a group
having common characters.</p>

<p>In the larvæ also we only find agreement in the
conditions of life within a much wider compass,
viz. within the whole order. Between the limits
of the order Lepidoptera the conditions of life in
the caterpillars are, as has just been shown, on the
whole very uniform, and the structure of the larvæ
accordingly agrees almost exactly in all Lepidopterous
families in every essential, <i>i.e.</i> typical, part.</p>

<p>In this way is explained the hitherto incomprehensible
phenomenon that the sub-ordinal group
<i>Rhopalocera</i> cannot be based on the larvæ, but
that Lepidopterous caterpillars can as a whole be
associated into a higher group (order); they constitute
altogether families and an order, but not
the intermediate group of a sub-order. By this
means we at the same time reply to an objection
that may be raised, viz. that larval forms cannot be
formed into high systematic groups because of
their “low and undeveloped” organization.</p>

<p>To this form of incongruence, viz. to the formation
of systematic groups of unequal value and
magnitude, I must attach the greatest weight with
respect to theoretical considerations. I maintain
that this, as I have already briefly indicated above,
is wholly incompatible with the admission of a
phyletic force. How is it conceivable that such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span>
power could work in the same organism in two
entirely different directions&mdash;that it should in the
same species lead to the constitution of quite
different systems for the larvæ and for the imagines,
or that it should lead only to the formation of
families in the larvæ and to sub-orders in the
imagines? If an internal force existed which had
a tendency to call into existence certain groups of
animal forms of such a nature that these constituted
one harmonious whole of which the components
bore to one another fixed morphological relationships,
it would certainly have been an easy matter
for such a power to have given to the larvæ of
butterflies some small character which would have
distinguished them as such, and which would in
some measure have impressed them with the stamp
of “<i>Rhopalocera</i>.” Of such a character we find
no trace however; on the contrary, everything goes
to show that the transformations of the organic
world result entirely from external influences.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h4 id="P2-2-3">III.<br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Incongruences in other Orders of Insects.</span></span></h4>

<p>Although the order Lepidoptera is for many
reasons especially favourable for an investigation
such as that undertaken in the previous section, it
will nevertheless be advantageous to inquire into
the form-relationships of the two chief stages in
some other orders of metamorphic insects, and to
investigate whether in these cases the formation
of systematic groups also coincides with common
conditions of life.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Hymenoptera.</span></h5>

<p>In this order there cannot be the least doubt as
to the form-relationship of the imagines. The
characteristic combination of the pro- and meso-thorax,
the number and venation of the wings, and
the mouth-organs formed for biting and licking, are
found throughout the whole order, and leave no
doubt that the Hymenoptera are well based on
their imaginal characters.</p>

<p>But it is quite different with the larvæ. It may
be boldly asserted that the order would never
have been founded if the larvæ only had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span>
known. Two distinct larval types here occur,
the one&mdash;caterpillar-like&mdash;possessing a distinct
horny head provided with the typical masticatory
organs of insects, and a body having thirteen segments,
to which, in addition to a variable number
of abdominal legs, there are always attached three
pairs of horny thoracic legs: the other type is
maggot-shaped, without the horny head, and is
entirely destitute of mouth-organs, or at least of
the three pairs of typical insect jaws, and is also
without abdominal and thoracic legs. The number
of segments is extremely variable; the larvæ of
the saw-flies have thirteen besides the head, the
maggot-shaped larvæ of bees possess fourteen
segments altogether, and the gall-flies and ichneumons
only twelve or ten. We should be much
mistaken also if we expected to find connecting
characters in the internal organs. The intestine
is quite different in the two types of larvæ, the
posterior opening being absent in the maggot-like
grubs; at most only the tracheal and nervous
systems show a certain agreement, but this is not
complete.</p>

<p>The order Hymenoptera, precisely speaking and
conceived only morphologically, exists therefore
but in the imagines; in the larvæ there exist only
the caterpillar- and maggot-formed groups. The
former shows a great resemblance to Lepidopterous
larvæ, and in the absence of all knowledge of
the further development it might be attempted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">483</a></span>
unite them with these into one group. The two
certainly differ in certain details of structure in the
mouth-organs and in the number of segments,
abdominal legs, &amp;c., to a sufficient extent to
warrant their being considered as two sub-orders
of one larval order; but they would in any case be
regarded as much more nearly related in form
than the caterpillar- and maggot-like types of the
Hymenopterous larvæ.</p>

<p>Is it not conceivable, however, that the imagines
of the Hymenoptera&mdash;that ichneumons and wasps
may be only accidentally alike, and that they have
in fact arisen from quite distinct ancestral forms,
the one having proceeded with the Lepidopterous
caterpillars from one root, and the other with the
grub-like Dipterous larvæ from another root?</p>

<p>This is certainly not the case; the common
characters are too deep-seated to allow the supposition
that the resemblance is here only superficial.
From the structure of the imagines alone the
common origin of all the Hymenoptera may be
inferred with great probability. This would be
raised into a certainty if we could demonstrate
the phyletic development of the maggot-formed
out of the caterpillar-formed Hymenopterous larvæ
by means of the ontogeny of the former. From
the beautiful investigations of Bütschli on the
embryonic development of <span class="locked">bees<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></span> we know that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">484</a></span>
embryo of the grub possesses a complete head,
consisting of four segments and provided with the
three typical pairs of jaws. These head segments
do not subsequently become formed into a true
horny head, but shrivel up; whilst the jaws disappear
with the exception of the first pair, which
are retained in the form of soft processes with
small horny points. We know also that from the
three foremost segments of the embryo the three
typical pairs of legs are developed in the form of
round buds, just as they first appear in all <span class="locked">insects.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></span>
These rudimentary limbs undergo complete degeneration
before the birth of the larva, as also do
those of the <span class="locked">whole<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a></span> of the remaining segments,
which, even in this primitive condition, show a
small difference to the three foremost rudimentary
legs.</p>

<p>The grub-like larvæ of the Hymenoptera have
therefore descended from forms which possessed a
horny head with antennæ and three pairs of
gnathites and a 13-segmented body, of which the
three foremost segments were provided with legs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">485</a></span>
differing somewhat from those of the other segments;
that is to say, they have descended from
larvæ which possessed a structure generally
similar to that of the existing saw-fly larvæ. The
common derivation of all the Hymenoptera from
one source is thus established with <span class="locked">certainty.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a></span></p>

<p>But upon what does this great inequality in the
form-relationship of the larvæ and imagines depend?
The existing maggot-like grubs are without
doubt much further removed from the active
caterpillar-like larvæ than are the saw-flies from
the Aculeate Hymenoptera. Whilst these two
groups differ only through various modifications
of the typical parts (limbs, &amp;c.), their larvæ are
separable by much deeper-seated distinctions;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">486</a></span>
limbs of typical importance entirely vanish in the
one group, but in the other attain to complete
development.</p>

<p>In the Hymenoptera there exists therefore a
very considerable incongruence in the systems
based morphologically, <i>i.e.</i> on the pure form-relationships
of the larvæ and of the imagines.
The reason of this is not difficult to find: <i>the
conditions of life differ much less in the case of
the imagines than in that of the larvæ</i>. In the
former the conditions of life are similar in their
broad features. Hymenoptera live chiefly in the
air and fly by day, and in their mode of
obtaining food do not present any considerable
differences. Their larvæ, on the other hand, live
under almost diametrically opposite conditions.
Those of the saw-flies live after the manner of
caterpillars upon or in plants, in both cases their
peculiar locomotion being adapted for the acquisition
and their masticatory organs for the reduction
of food. The larvæ of the other Hymenoptera,
however, do not as a rule require any means of
locomotion for reaching nor any organs of mastication
for swallowing their food, since they are fed in
cells, like the bees and wasps, or grow up in plant
galls of which they suck the juice, or are parasitic
on other insects by whose blood they are nourished.
We can readily comprehend that in the whole of
this last group the legs should disappear, that the
jaws should likewise vanish or should become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">487</a></span>
diminished to one pair retained in a much reduced
condition, that the horny casing of the head, the
surface of attachment of the muscles of the jaws,
should consequently be lost, and that even the
segments of the head itself should become more
or less shrivelled up as the organs of sense therein
located became suppressed.</p>

<p>The incongruence manifests itself however in
yet another manner than by the relatively greater
morphological divergence of the larvæ: a different
grouping is possible for the larvæ and for
the imagines. If we divide the Hymenoptera
simply according to the form-relationships of the
imagines, the old division into the two sub-orders
<i>Terebrantia</i> or <i>Ditrocha</i> and <i>Aculeata</i> or <i>Monotrocha</i>
will be the most correct. The distinguishing
characters of a sting or ovipositor and a
one- or two-jointed trochanter are still of the
greatest value. But these two sub-orders do not
by any means correspond with the two types of
larvæ since, in the <i>Terebrantia</i>, there occur
families with both caterpillar-formed and maggot-formed
larvæ.</p>

<p>The cause is to be found in that a portion of
these families possess larvæ which are parasitic in
other insects or in galls, their bodily structure
having by these means become transformed in a
quite different direction. The mode of life of the
imagines is, on the other hand, essentially the
same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">488</a></span></p>

<p>We have here therefore another case like that
which we met with among the Rhopalocerous
Lepidoptera, in which the imagines appear to be
capable of being formed into a higher group than
the larvæ, because the former live under conditions
of life which are on the whole similar whilst the
latter live under very divergent conditions.</p>

<p>The old division of the Hymenoptera into two
sub-orders has certainly been abandoned in the later
zoological text-books; they are now divided into
three:&mdash;saw-flies, parasitic, and aculeate Hymenoptera;
but even this arrangement has been
adopted with reference to the different structure
of the larvæ. Whether this system is better than
the older, <i>i.e.</i> whether it better expresses the
<i>genealogical</i> relationship, I will not now stop to
<span class="locked">investigate.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></span></p>

<h5><span class="smcap">DIPTERA.</span></h5>

<p>The imagines of the Diptera (<i>genuina</i>), with the
exception of the <i>Aphaniptera</i> and <i>Pupipara</i>, agree
in all their chief characters, such as the number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span>
and structure of the wings, the number and joints
of the legs, the peculiar formation of the thorax
(fusion of the three segments);<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> and even the structure
of the mouth organs varies only within narrow
limits. This is in accordance with their mode of
life, which is very uniform in its main features: all
the true Diptera live in the light, moving chiefly
by means of flight, but having also the power of
running; all those which take food in the imago
condition feed upon fluids. Their larvæ, on the
other hand, are formed on two essentially different
types, the one&mdash;which I shall designate as the
gnat-type&mdash;possessing a horny head with eyes,
three pairs of jaws, and long or short antennæ,
together with a 12- or 13-segmented body, which
is never provided with the three typical pairs of
thoracic legs, but frequently has the so-called
abdominal legs on the first and last segments.
The other Dipterous larvæ are maggot-shaped
and without a horny head, or in fact without any
head, since the first segment, the homologue of the
head, can in no case be distinguished through its
being larger than the others; it is on the contrary
much smaller. The typical insect mouth-parts are
entirely absent, being replaced by a variously
formed and quite peculiar arrangement of hooks
situated on the mouth and capable of protrusion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span>
Never more than eleven segments are present
besides the first, which is destitute of eyes; neither
are abdominal legs ever developed.</p>

<p>The mode of life differs very considerably in the
two groups of larvæ. Although the Dipterous
maggots are not as a rule quite incapable of locomotion
like the grubs of the Hymenoptera (bees,
ichneumons), the majority are nevertheless possessed
of but little power of movement in the
food-substance on which they were deposited as
eggs. They do not go in search of food, either
because they are parasitic in other insects in the
same manner as the ichneumons (<i>Tachina</i>), or else
they live on decaying animal or vegetable substances
or amidst large swarms of their prey, like
the larvæ of the <i>Syrphidæ</i> amongst <i>Aphides</i>.
They generally undergo pupation in the same
place as that which they inhabit as larvæ and indeed
in their larval skin which hardens into an
oval pupa-case. Some few leave their feeding
place and pupate after traversing a short distance
(<i>Eristalis</i>).</p>

<p>As in the case of the Hymenoptera the structure
of the larvæ can here also be explained by
peculiarities in their mode of life. Creatures which
live in a mass of food neither require special
organs of locomotion nor specially developed
organs of sense (eyes). They have no use for
the three pairs of jaws since they only feed on
liquid substances, and the hooks within the mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span>
do not serve for the reduction of food but only for
fastening the whole body. With the jaws and
their muscular system there likewise disappears
the necessity for a hard surface of attachment,
<i>i.e.</i> a corneous head.</p>

<p>The mode of life of the larvæ of the gnat-type
is quite different in most points. The
majority, and indeed the most typically formed of
these, have to go in search of their food, whether
they are predaceous, such as the <i>Culicidæ</i> and
many of the other <i>Nemocera</i> (<i>Corethra</i>, <i>Simulium</i>),
or whether they feed on plants, which they in some
cases weave into a protective dwelling tube (certain
species of <i>Chironomus</i>). Many live in water and
move with great rapidity; others bury in the
earth or in vegetable substances; and even those
species which live on fungi sometimes wander
great distances, as in the well-known case of the
“army worm” where thousands of the larvæ of
<i>Sciara Thomæ</i> thus migrate.</p>

<p>Now the two types of larvæ correspond generally
with the two large groups into which, as it
appears to me correctly, the Diptera (<i>genuina</i>) are
as a rule divided. In this respect there is therefore
an equality of form-relationship&mdash;the grouping
is the same, and the incongruence depends
only upon the form-divergence between the two
kinds of larvæ being greater than between the
two kinds of <span class="locked">imagines.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">492</a></span></p>

<p>That the form-divergence is greater in the
larvæ than in the imagines cannot be doubted;
that this distant form-relationship cannot, however,
be referred to a very remote common origin,
<i>i.e.</i> to a very remote blood-relationship, not only
appears from the existence of transition-forms
between the two sub-orders, but can be demonstrated
here, as in the case of the Hymenoptera,
by the embryonic development of the maggot-like
larvæ.</p>

<p>Seventeen years ago I <span class="locked">showed<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></span> that the grub-formed
larvæ of the <i>Muscidæ</i> in the embryonic
state possessed a well-developed head with antennæ
and three pairs of jaws, but that later in the course
of the embryonic development a marked reduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">493</a></span>
and transformation of these parts takes place,
so that finally the four head segments appear as a
single small ring formed from the coalesced pairs
of maxillæ, whilst the so-called “fore-head” (the
first head segment), together with the mandibles,
becomes transformed into a suctorial-head armed
with hooks and lying within the body. At the
time of writing I drew no conclusion from these
facts with reference to the phyletic development
of these larval forms; nor did Bütschli, six years
later, in the precisely analogous case of the larvæ
of the bees. The inference is, however, so obvious
that it is astonishing that it should not
have been drawn till the present <span class="locked">time.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a></span></p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the maggot-like
larvæ of insects are not by any means ancient
forms, but are, on the contrary, quite recent, as
first pointed out by Fritz Müller,<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> and afterwards
by <span class="locked">Packard<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></span> and <span class="locked">Brauer,<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></span> and as is maintained in
the latest work by Paul <span class="locked">Mayer<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a></span> on the phylogeny
of insects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">494</a></span></p>

<p>The Dipterous maggots have evidently
descended from a larval form which possessed a
horny head with antennæ and three pairs of jaws,
but which had no appendages to the abdominal
segments; they are therefore ordinary Dipterous
larvæ of the gnat-type which have become modified
in a quite peculiar manner and adapted to a
new mode of life, just as the grubs of the Hymenoptera
are larvæ of the saw-fly type, which have
become similarly transformed, although by no
means in the same manner. The resemblance
between the two types of larva is to a great
extent purely external, and depends upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">495</a></span>
process designated “convergence” by Oscar
Schmidt, <i>i.e.</i> upon the adaptation of heterogeneous
animal forms to similar conditions of life. By
adaptation to a life within a mass of fluid nutriment,
the caterpillar-formed larvæ of the Hymenoptera
and the <i>Tipula</i>-like larvæ of the Diptera
have acquired a similar external appearance, and
many similarities in internal structure, or, in brief,
have attained to a considerable degree of form-relationship,
which would certainly have tended
to conceal the wide divergence in blood-relationship
did not the embryological forms on the one
side and the imagines on the other provide us
with an explanation.</p>

<p>It is certainly of great interest that in another
order of insects&mdash;the Coleoptera&mdash;grub-formed
larvæ occur quite irregularly, and their origin can
be here traced to precisely the same conditions of
life as those which have produced the grubs of
bees. I refer to the honey-devouring larvæ of
the <i>Meloïdæ</i> (<i>Meloë</i>, <i>Sitaris</i>, <i>Cantharis</i>). The
case is the more instructive, inasmuch that the
six-legged larval form is not yet relegated to the
development within the egg, but is retained in the
first larval stage. In the <i>second larval stage</i> the
maggot-form is first assumed, although this is certainly
not so well pronounced as in the Diptera
or Hymenoptera, as neither the head nor the
thoracic legs are so completely suppressed as in
these orders. Nevertheless, these parts have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">496</a></span>
made a great advance in the process of transformation.</p>

<p>The grub-like larvæ of the Hymenoptera and
Diptera appear to me especially instructive with
reference to the main question of the causes of
transformation. The reply to the questions:
what gives the impetus to change? is this
impetus internal or external? can scarcely be
given with greater clearness than here. If these
larvæ have abandoned their ancestral form and
have acquired a widely divergent structure, arising
not only from suppression but partly also from an
essentially new differentiation (suctorial head of
the <i>Muscidæ</i>), and if these structural changes show
a close adaptation to the existing conditions of
life, from these considerations alone it is difficult
to conceive how such transformations can depend
upon the action of a phyletic force. The latter
must have foreseen that at precisely this or that
fixed period of time the ancestors of these larvæ
would have been placed under conditions of life
which would make it desirable for them to be
modified into the maggot-type. But if at the
same time the imagines are removed in a less
degree from those of the caterpillar-like larvæ,
this divergence being in exact relation with the
deviations in the conditions of life, I at least fail
to see how we can escape the consequence that it
is the external conditions of life which produce
the transformations and induce the organism to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">497</a></span>
change. It is to me incomprehensible how one
and the same vital force can in the same individual
induce one stage to become transformed
feebly and the other stage strongly, these transformations
corresponding in extent with the
stronger or weaker deviations in the conditions of
life to which the organism is exposed in the two
stages; to say nothing of the fact that by such
unequal divergences the idea of a perfect system
(creative thought) is completely upset.</p>

<p>Nor can the objection be raised that we are
here only concerned with insignificant changes&mdash;with
nothing more than the arrested development
of single organs and so forth, in brief, only with
those changes which can be ascribed to the action
of the environment.</p>

<p>We are here as little concerned with a mere
suppression of organs through arrested development
as in the case of the Cirripedia; the transformation
and reconstruction of the whole body
goes even much further than in these Crustacea,
although not so conspicuous externally. Where
do we elsewhere find insects having the head
inside a cavity of the body (sectorial head of the
<i>Muscidæ</i>), and of which the foremost segment&mdash;the
physiological representative of the head&mdash;consists
entirely of the coalesced antennæ and
pairs of maxillæ?</p>

<p>The incongruences in the form-relationships
are, however, exceedingly numerous in the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">498</a></span>
of the Diptera, and a special treatise would be
necessary to discuss them thoroughly. I may
here mention only one case, because the inequality
shows itself in this instance in a quite
opposite sense.</p>

<p>Gerstäcker, who is certainly a competent entomologist,
divides the Diptera into three tribes, viz.
the <i>Diptera genuina</i>, the <i>Pupipara</i>, and the
<i>Aphaniptera</i>. The latter, the fleas, possess in
their divided thoracic segments and in their jointed
labial appendages characters so widely divergent
from those of the true Diptera and of the <i>Pupipara</i>
that Latreille and the English zoologists have
separated them entirely from the Diptera and have
raised them into a separate <span class="locked">order.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></span> Those who do
not agree in this arrangement, but with Gerstäcker
include the fleas under the Diptera, will nevertheless
admit that the morphological divergence between
the <i>Aphaniptera</i> and the two other tribes is
far greater than that which exists between the
latter. Now the larvæ of the fleas are completely
similar in structure to those of the gnat-type,
since they possess a corneous head with
the typical mouth parts and antennæ and a
13-segmented body devoid of legs. Were we only
acquainted with the larvæ of the fleas we should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">499</a></span>
rank them with the true Diptera under the sub-order
<i>Nemocera</i>. On first finding such a larva we
should expect to see emerge from the pupa a small
gnat.</p>

<p>While the imagines of the <i>Nemocera</i> and
<i>Aphaniptera</i> thus show but a very remote form-relationship
their larvæ are very closely allied.
Can any one doubt that in this case it is not the
larva but the imago which has diverged to the
greatest extent? Have not the fleas moreover
become adapted to conditions of life widely
different from those of all other Diptera, whilst
their larvæ do not differ in this respect from many
other Dipterous larvæ?</p>

<p>We have here, therefore, another case of unequal
phyletic development, which manifests itself in
the entirely different form-relationship of the larvæ
and the imagines. Thus in this case, as in that of
the Lepidoptera, it is sometimes the larval and at
other times the imaginal stage which has experienced
the greatest transformation, and, as in
the order mentioned, the objection that a phyletic
vital force produces greater and more important
differentiations in the higher imaginal stage than in
the lower or less developed larval stage, is equally
ineffectual.</p>

<p>If, however, it be asked whether the unequal
phyletic development depends in this case upon an
unequal number of transforming impulses which
the two stages may have experienced during an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">500</a></span>
equal period of time, this must be decidedly
answered in the negative. The unequal development
obviously depends in this case, as in the
higher systematic groups of the Lepidoptera, upon
the unequal value of the parts affected by the
changes. These parts are on the one side of
small importance, and on the other side of great
importance, to the whole structure of the insect.
This is shown in the last-mentioned case of the
fleas, where, of the typical parts of the body, only
the wings have become rudimentary, whilst the
antennæ, mouth-parts, and legs, and even the form
and mode of segmentation (free thoracic segments),
must have suffered most important modifications;
their larvæ, on the other hand, can have experienced
only unimportant changes, since they
still agree in all typical parts with those of the
gnat-type.</p>

<p>Although therefore in this and in similar cases a
greater number of transforming impulses may well
have occurred on the one side than on the other&mdash;and
it is indeed highly probable that this number
has not been absolutely the same&mdash;nevertheless
the chief cause of the striking incongruence is not
to be found therein, but rather in the <i>strength</i> of
the transforming impulses, if I may be permitted
to employ this figure, or, more precisely expressed,
in the importance of the parts which become
changed and at the same time in the amount of
change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">501</a></span></p>

<p>In this conclusion there is implied as it appears
to me an important theoretical result which tells
further against the efficacy of a phyletic force.</p>

<p>If the so-called “typical parts” of an animal
disappear completely through the action of the
environment only, and still further, if these parts
can become so entirely modified as to give rise to
quite new and again typical structures (suctorial
head of the <i>Muscidæ</i>) without the typical parts of
the other stage of the same individual being
thereby modified and transformed into a new type
of structure, how can we maintain a distinction
between typical and non-typical parts with respect
to their origin? But if a difference exists with
respect only to the physiological importance of
such parts, <i>i.e.</i> their importance for the equilibrium
of the whole organization, while, with reference to
transformation and suppression, exactly the same
influences appear to be effective as those which
bring about a change in or a disappearance of the
so-called adventitious parts, where is there left any
scope for the operation of the supposed phyletic
force? What right have we to assume that the
typical structures arise by the action of a vital
force? Nevertheless this is the final refuge of
those who are bound to admit that a great number
of parts or characters of an animal can become
changed, suppressed, or even produced by the
action of the environment.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Summary and Conclusion.</span></span></h4>

<p>The question heading the second section of this
essay must at the conclusion of the investigation
be answered in the negative. The form-relationship
of the larvæ does not always coincide with
that of the imagines, or, in other words, a system
based entirely on the morphology of the larvæ does
not always coincide with that founded entirely
on the morphology of the imagines.</p>

<p>Two kinds of incongruence here present themselves.
The first arises from the different amount
of divergence between two systematic groups in
the larvæ and in the imagines, these groups being
of equal extent. The second form of incongruence
consists essentially in that the two stages
form systematic groups of different extents, either
the one stage constituting a group of a higher
order than the other and therefore forming a
group of unequal value, or else the two stages
form groups of equal systematic value, these
groups, however, not coinciding in extent, but the
one overlapping the other.</p>

<p>This second form of incongruence is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">503</a></span>
frequently connected with the first kind, and is
mostly the direct consequence of the latter.</p>

<p>The cause of the incongruences is to be found
in unequal phyletic development, either the one
stage within the same period of time having been
influenced by a greater number of transforming impulses
than the other, or else these impulses
have been different in strength, <i>i.e.</i> have affected
parts of greater or less physiological value, or
have influenced parts of equal value with unequal
strength.</p>

<p>In all these cases in which there are deep-rooted
form-differences, it can be shown that these
correspond exactly with inequalities in the conditions
of life, this correspondence being in two
directions, viz. in strength and in extent: the
former determines the <i>degree</i> of form-difference,
the latter its <i>extent</i> throughout a larger or smaller
group of species.</p>

<p>The different forms of incongruence are manifested
in the following <span class="locked">manner:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1.) Different amount of form-divergence
between the larvæ on the one side and the
imagines on the other. Among the Lepidoptera
this is found most frequently in varieties and
species, and there is evidence to show that in this
case the one stage has been affected by transforming
influences, either alone (varieties), or at
any rate to a greater extent (species). In the
last case it can be shown in many ways that one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">504</a></span>
stage (the larva) has actually remained at an older
phyletic grade (<i>Deilephila</i> species). Incongruences
of this kind depending entirely upon the
more frequent action of transforming impulses can
only become observable in the smaller systematic
groups, in the larger they elude comparative examination.
In the higher groups unequal form-divergence
may be produced by the transforming
impulses affecting parts of unequal physiological
and morphological value, or by their influencing
parts of equal value in different degrees. All
effects of this kind can, however, only become
manifest after a long-continued accumulation of
single changes, <i>i.e.</i> only in those systematic
groups which require a long period of time for
their formation. By this means we can completely
explain why the incongruences of form-divergence
continually diminish from varieties to genera, and
then increase again from genera upwards through
families, tribes, and sub-orders: the first diminishing
incongruence depends upon an <i>unequal
number</i> of transforming impulses, the latter increasing
incongruence depends upon the <i>unequal
power</i> of these impulses.</p>

<p>Cases of the second kind are found among
the Lepidopterous families, and especially in the
higher groups (<i>Rhopalocera</i> and <i>Heterocera</i>), and
appear still more striking in the higher groups of
the Hymenoptera and Diptera. Thus the caterpillar
shaped and maggot-formed larvæ of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">505</a></span>
Hymenoptera differ from one another to a much
greater extent than their imagines, since the
latter have experienced a complete transformation
of typical parts; whilst in the caterpillar-formed
larvæ these parts vary only within moderate limits.
Similarly in the case of the Diptera, of which the
gnat-like larvæ diverge more widely from those of
the grub type than do the gnats from the true
flies. On the other hand the divergence between
the imagines of the fleas and gnats is considerably
greater than that between their larvæ&mdash;indeed
the larvæ of the fleas would have to be ranked as
a family of the sub-order of the gnat-like larvæ
if we wished to carry out a larval classification.
By this it is also made evident that these unequal
divergences, when they occur in the higher
systematic groups, always induce at the same
time the second form of incongruence&mdash;that of the
formation of unequal systematic groups.</p>

<p>In general whenever such unequal divergences
occur in the higher groups they run parallel with
a strong deviation in the conditions of life. If
these differ more strongly on the side of the
larvæ, we find that the structure of the latter likewise
diverges the more widely, and that their
form-relationship is in consequence made more
remote (saw-flies and ichneumons, gnats and flies);
if, on the other hand, the difference in the conditions
of life is greater on the side of the
imagines, we find among the latter the greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">506</a></span>
morphological divergence (butterflies and moths,
gnats and fleas).</p>

<p>(2.) The second chief form of incongruence
consists in the formation of different systematic
groups by the larvæ and the imagines, if the latter
are grouped simply according to their form-relationship
without reference to their genetic
affinities. This incongruence again shows itself
in two forms&mdash;in the formation of groups of
unequal value, and the formation of groups equal
in value but unequal in extent, <i>i.e.</i> of overlapping
instead of coinciding groups.</p>

<p>Of these two forms the first arises as the direct
result of a different amount of divergence. Thus
the larvæ of the fleas, on account of their small
divergence from those of the gnats, could only
lay claim to the rank of a <i>family</i>, whilst their
imagines are separated from the gnats by such a
wide form-divergence that they are correctly
ranked as a distinct <i>tribe</i> or <i>sub-order</i>.</p>

<p>The inequalities in the lowest groups, varieties,
can be regarded in a precisely similar manner. If
the larva of a species has become split up into
two local forms, but not the imago, each of the
two larval forms possesses only the rank of a
<i>variety</i>, whilst the imaginal form has the value of a
<i>species</i>.</p>

<p>Less simple are the causes of the phenomenon
that in the one stage the lower groups can be
combined into one of higher rank, whilst the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">507</a></span>
stage does not attain to this high rank. Such a
condition appears especially complicated when the
two stages can again be formed into groups of a
still higher rank.</p>

<p>This is the case in the tribe <i>Rhopalocera</i>, which
is founded on the imagines alone, the larvæ forming
only families of butterflies. Both stages can
however be again combined into the highest
systematic group of the Lepidoptera.</p>

<p>In this case also the difference in the value of
the systematic groups formed by the two stages
corresponds precisely with the difference in the
conditions of life. This appears very distinctly
when there are several sub-groups on each side,
and not when, as in the fleas, only one family is
present as a tribe on the one side and on the
other as a family. Thus in the butterflies, on the
one side there are numerous families combined
into the higher rank of a sub-order (imagines),
whilst on the other side (larvæ) a group of the
same extent cannot be formed. In this instance
it can be distinctly shown that the combination of
the families into a group of a higher order, as is
possible on the side of the imagines, corresponds
exactly with the limits in which the conditions of
life deviate from those of other Lepidopterous
families. The group of butterflies corresponds
with an equally large circle of uniform conditions
of life, whilst a similar uniformity is wanting on
the side of the larvæ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">508</a></span></p>

<p>The second kind of unequal group formation
arises from the circumstance that groups of equal
value can be formed from the two stages, but
these groups do not possess the same limits&mdash;they
overlap, and only coincide in part.</p>

<p>This is most clearly seen in the order Hymenoptera,
in which both larvæ and imagines form
two well-defined morphological sub-orders, but
in such a manner that the one larval form not
only prevails throughout the whole of the one
sub-order of the imagines, but also extends beyond
and spreads over a great portion of the other
imaginal sub-order.</p>

<p>Here again the dependence of this phenomenon
upon the influence of the environment is very
distinct, since it can be demonstrated (by the
embryology of bees) that the one form of larva&mdash;the
maggot-type&mdash;although the structure now
diverges so widely, has been developed from the
other form, and that it must have arisen by adaptation
to certain widely divergent conditions of life.</p>

<p>This form of incongruence is always connected
with unequal divergence between the two stages of
the one systematic group&mdash;in this case the <i>Terebrantia</i>.
The larvæ of this imaginal group partly
possess caterpillar-like (<i>Phytospheces</i>) and partly
maggot-formed (<i>Entomospheces</i>) larvæ, and differ
from one another to a considerably greater extent
than the saw-flies from the <span class="locked">ichneumons.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a></span> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">509</a></span>
final cause of the incongruence lies therefore in this
case also in the fact that one stage has suffered
stronger changes than the other, so that a deeper
division of the group has occurred in the former
than in the latter.</p>

<p>The analogous incongruences in single families
of the Lepidoptera may have arisen in a similar
manner, as has already been more clearly shown
above; only in these cases we are as yet unable
to prove in detail that the larval structure has
become more strongly changed through special
external conditions of life than that of the
imagines.</p>

<p>In the smallest systematic group&mdash;varieties, it
has been possible to furnish some proof of this.
The one-sided change here depends in part upon
the <i>direct action</i> of external influences (seasonal
dimorphism, climatic variation), and it can be shown
that these influences (temperature) acted only on
the one stage, and accordingly induced change in
this alone whilst the other stage remained unaltered.</p>

<p>It has now been shown&mdash;not indeed in every individual
case, but for each of the different kinds of
incongruence of form-relationship&mdash;that there is an
exact parallelism corresponding throughout with
the incongruence in the conditions of life.
Wherever the forms diverge more widely in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">510</a></span>
stage than in the other we also find more widely
divergent conditions of life; wherever the morphological
systemy of one stage fails to coincide
with that of the other&mdash;whether in the extent
or in the value of the groups&mdash;the conditions of
life in that stage also diverge, either more widely
or at the same time within other limits; whenever
a morphological group can be constructed from
one stage but not from the other, we find that this
stage alone is submitted to certain common conditions
of life which fail in the other stage.</p>

<p>The law that the divergence in form always
corresponds exactly with the divergence in the
conditions of <span class="locked">life<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></span> has accordingly received confirmation
in all cases where we have been able to
pronounce judgment. Unequal form-divergences
correspond precisely with unequal divergence in
the conditions of life, and community of form
appears within exactly the same limits as community
in the conditions of life.</p>

<p>These investigations may thus be concluded
with the following law:&mdash;In types of similar origin,
<i>i.e.</i> having the same blood-relationship, the degree
of morphological relationship corresponds exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">511</a></span>
with the degree of difference in the conditions of
life in the two stages.</p>

<p>With respect to the question as to the final
cause of transformation this result is certainly of
the greatest importance.</p>

<p>The interdependence of structure and function
has often been insisted upon, but so long as this
has reference only to the agreement of each particular
form with some special mode of life, this
harmony could still be regarded as the result of a
directive power; but when in metamorphic forms
we not only see a double agreement between structure
and function, but also that the transformation
of the form occurs in the two chief developmental
stages in successive steps at unequal rates and with
unequal strength and rhythm, we must&mdash;at least
so it appears to me&mdash;abandon the idea of an inherent
transforming force; and this becomes the
more necessary when, by means of the opposite and
extremely simple assumption that transformations
result entirely from the response of the organism
to the actions of the environment, all the phenomena&mdash;so
far as our knowledge of facts at
present extends&mdash;can be satisfactorily explained.
A power compelling transformation, <i>i.e.</i> a phyletic
vital force, must be abandoned, on the double
ground that it is incapable of explaining the
phenomena (incongruence and unequal phyletic
development), and further because it is superfluous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">512</a></span></p>

<p>Against the latter half of this argument there
can at most be raised but the one objection that
the phenomena of transformation are not completely
represented by the cases here analysed.
In so far as this signifies that the whole organic
world, animal and vegetable, has not been comprised
within the investigation this objection is
quite valid. The question may be raised as to the
limit to which we may venture to extend the results
obtained from one small group of forms.
I shall return to this question in the last essay.</p>

<p>But if by this objection it is meant that the
restricted field of the investigation enables us to
actually analyse only a portion of the occurring
<span class="locked">transformations,<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></span> and indeed only those cases, the
dependence of which upon the external conditions
of life would be generally admitted, I will not
let pass the opportunity of once more pointing out
at the conclusion of the present essay that the
incongruences shown to exist by no means depend
only upon those more superficial characters
the remodelling of which in accordance with the
external conditions of life may be most easily discerned
and is most difficult to deny, but that in
certain cases (maggot-like Dipterous larvæ) it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">513</a></span>
precisely the “typical” parts which become
partly suppressed and partly converted into an
entirely new structure. From the ancient typical
appendages there have here arisen new structures,
which again have every right to be considered as
typical. This transformation is not to be compared
with that experienced by the swimming appendages
of the <i>Nauplius</i>-like ancestor of an <i>Apus</i>
or <i>Branchipus</i> which have become mandibulate,
nor with the transformation which the anterior
limbs must have gone through in the reptilian
ancestors of birds. The changes in question
(Dipterous larvæ) go still further and are more
profound. I lay great emphasis upon this because
we have here one of the few cases which show
that typical parts are quite as dependent upon the
environment as untypical structures, and that the
former are not only able to become adapted to
external conditions by small modifications&mdash;as
shown in a most striking manner by the transformations
of the appendages in the Crustacea and
Vertebrata&mdash;but that these parts can become
modelled on an entirely new type which, when
perfected, gives no means of divining its mode of
origin. I may here repeat a former statement:&mdash;With
reference to the causes of their origination
we have no grounds for drawing a distinction between
typical and untypical structures.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned in concluding that quite
analogous although less sharply defined results are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">514</a></span>
arrived at if, instead of fixing our attention upon
the different stages of a systematic group in their
phyletic development, we only compare the different
functional parts (organs in the wide sense) of
the organisms.</p>

<p>A complete parallel can be drawn between the
two classes of developmental phenomena. From
the very different systematic values attached by
taxonomists to this or that organ in a group of
animals, it may be concluded that the individual
parts of an organism are to a certain extent independent,
and that each can vary independently,
when affected either entirely alone or in a preponderating
degree by transforming impulses, without
all the other parts of the organism likewise suffering
transformation, or at least without their becoming
modified in an equal degree. Did all the
parts and organs in two groups of animals diverge
from each other to the same extent, the systematic
value of such parts would be perfectly equal; we
should, for example, be able to distinguish and
characterize two genera of the family of mice by
their kidneys, their liver, their salivary glands, or
by the histological structure of their hair or
muscles, or even by differences in their myology,
&amp;c. equally as well as by their teeth, length of
toes, &amp;c. It is true that such a diagnosis has yet
to be attempted; but it may safely be predicted
that it would not succeed. Judging from all the
facts at present before us, the individual parts&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">515</a></span>
especially those connected in their physiological
action, <i>i.e.</i> the system of organs&mdash;do not keep pace
with reference to the modifications which the
species undergoes in the course of time; at one
period one system and at another period some
other system of organs advances while the others
remain behind.</p>

<p>This corresponds exactly with the result already
deduced from the unparallel development of the
independent ontogenetic stages. If the inequality
in the phyletic development is more sharply pronounced
in this than in the last class of cases, this
can be explained by the greater degree of correlation
which exists between the individual systems
of organs in any single organism as compared
with that existing between the ontogenetic stages,
which, although developed from one another, are
nevertheless almost completely independent. We
should have expected <i>à priori</i> that a strong correlation
would have here existed, but as a matter of
fact this is not the case, or is so only in a very
small degree.</p>

<p>Just as in the stages of metamorphosis the inequality
of phyletic development becomes the
more obliterated the more distant and comprehensive,
or, in other words, the greater the period of
existence of the groups which we compare, so does
the unequal divergence of the systems of organs
become obliterated as we bring into comparison
larger and larger systematic groups.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">516</a></span></p>

<p>It is not inconceivable&mdash;although a clear proof
of this is certainly as yet wanting&mdash;that a variety
of the ancestral species would differ only in one
single character, such as hairiness, colour, or
marking, and such instances would thus agree
precisely with the foregoing cases in which only
the caterpillar or the butterfly formed a variety.
All the more profound modifications however&mdash;such
for instance as those which determine the difference
between two species&mdash;are never limited to
one character, but always affect several, this being
explicable by correlation, which, as Darwin has
shown in the case of dogs, may cause modifications
in the skull of those breeds having hanging ears in
consequence of this last character alone. It must
be admitted however that one organ only would
be originally affected by a modifying influence.
Thus, I am acquainted with two species of a
genus of Daphniacea which are so closely allied
that they can only be distinguished from one
another by a close comparison of individual details.
But whilst most of the external and internal
organs are almost identical in the two
species the sperm-cells of the males differ in a
most striking manner, in one species resembling
an Australian boomerang in form and in the other
being spherical! An analogous instance is furnished
by <i>Daphnia Pulex</i> and <i>D. Magna</i>, two species
which were for a long time confounded. Nearly
all the parts of the body are here exactly alike,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">517</a></span>
but the antennæ of the males differ to a remarkable
extent, as was first correctly shown by
Leydig.</p>

<p>Similarly in the case of genera there may be
observed an incongruence of such a kind that individual
parts of the body may deviate to a
greater or to a less extent than the corresponding
parts in an allied genus. If, for instance, we compare
a species of the genus of Daphniacea, <i>Sida</i>, with
a species of the nearly allied genus <i>Daphnella</i>, we
find that all the external and internal organs are in
some measure dissimilar&mdash;nevertheless certain of
these parts deviate to an especially large extent,
and have without question become far more transformed
than the others. This is the case, for
example, with the antennæ and the male sexual
organs. The latter, in <i>Daphnella</i>, open out at the
sides of the posterior part of the body as long,
boot-shaped generative organs, and in <i>Sida</i> as
small papillæ on the ventral side of this region of
the body. If again we compare <i>Daphnella</i> with
the nearly allied genus <i>Latona</i>, it will be found that
no part in the one is exactly similar to the
corresponding part in the other genus, whilst certain
organs differ more widely than others. This
is the case for instance with the oar-like appendages
which in <i>Latona</i> are triramous, but in
<i>Daphnella</i>, as in almost all the other Daphniacea,
only biramous.</p>

<p>In families the estimation of the form-divergence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">518</a></span>
of the systems of organs and parts of the body
becomes difficult and uncertain: still it may
safely be asserted that the two Cladocerous
families <i>Polyphemidæ</i> and <i>Daphniidæ</i> differ much
less from one another in the structure of their oar-like
appendages than in that of their other parts,
such as the head, shell, legs, or abdominal
segments. In systematic groups of a still higher
order, <i>i.e.</i> in orders, and still more in classes, we
might be inclined to consider that all the organs
had become modified to an equally great extent.
Nevertheless it cannot be conclusively said that
the kidneys of a bird differ from those of a
mammal to the same extent as do the feathers
from mammalian hair, since we cannot estimate
the differences between quite heterogeneous things&mdash;it
can only be stated that both differ greatly.
Here also the facts are not such as would have
been expected if transformation was the result of
an internal developmental force; no uniform
modification of <i>all</i> parts takes place, but first one
part varies (variety) and then others (species), and,
on the whole, as the systematic divergence increases
all parts become more and more affected
by the transformation and all tend continually to
appear changed to an equal extent. This is precisely
what would be expected if the transforming
impulses came from the environment. An equalization
of the differences caused by transformation
must be produced in two ways; first by correlation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">519</a></span>
since nearly every primary transformation must
entail one or more secondary changes, and
secondly because, as the period of time increases,
more numerous parts of the body must become
influenced by primary transforming factors.</p>

<p>A tempting theme is here also offered by
attempting to trace the inequality of phyletic
development to dissimilar external influences, and
by demonstrating that individual organs have as a
rule become modified in proportion to the divergence
in the conditions of life by which they have
been influenced, this action, during a given period
of time, having been more frequent in the case of
one organ than in that of the others, or, in brief,
by showing the connection between the causes and
effects of transformation.</p>

<p>It would be quite premature, however, to undertake
such a labour at present, since it will be long
before physiology is able to account for the fine
distinctions shown by morphology, and further because
we have as yet no insight into those internal
adjustments of the organism which would enable us
<i>à priori</i> to deduce definite secondary changes from
a given primary transformation. But so long as
this is impossible we have no means of distinguishing
correlative changes from the primary modifications
producing them, unless they happen to arise
under our observation.</p>

<p><i>Ontogeny of the Noctua larvæ.</i>&mdash;References have already
been given in a previous note (<a href="#Footnote_67">67</a>, p. <a href="#Page_166">166</a>) to observations
on the number of legs and geometer-like habits of
certain <i>Noctua</i>-larvæ when newly hatched. This interesting
fact in the development of these insects furnishes
a most instructive application of the principle of
ontogeny to the determination of the true affinities, <i>i.e.</i>
the blood-relationship of certain groups of Lepidoptera.
While the foregoing portions of this work have been in
course of preparation for the press, some additional
observations on this subject have been published, and I
may take the present opportunity of pointing out their
systematic bearing&mdash;not, indeed, with a view to settling
definitively the positions of the groups in question, as
our knowledge is still somewhat scanty&mdash;but with the
object of stimulating further investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. H. T. Stainton has lately recorded the fact that
the young larva of <i>Triphæna Pronuba</i> is a semi-looper
(Ent. Mo. Mag. vol. xvii. p. 135); and in a recently
published life-history of <i>Euclidia Glyphica</i> (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 210)
Mr. G. T. Porritt states that this caterpillar is a true
looper when young, but becomes a semi-looper when
adult. To these facts Mr. R. F. Logan adds (<i>Ibid.</i>
p. 237) that “nearly all the larvæ of the <i>Trifidæ</i> are
semi-loopers when first hatched.” The <i>Cymatophoræ</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">521</a></span>
appear to be an exception, but Mr. Logan points out
that this genus is altogether aberrant, and seems to be
allied to the <i>Tortricidæ</i>. Summing up the results of
these and the observations previously referred to, it will
be seen that this developmental character has now been
established in the case of species belonging to the
following families of the section <i>Genuinæ</i>:&mdash;<i>Leucaniidæ</i>,
<i>Apameidæ</i>, <i>Caradrinidæ</i>, <i>Noctuidæ</i>, <i>Orthosiidæ</i>, <i>Hadenidæ</i>,
and <i>Xylinidæ</i>, as well as the other <i>Trifidæ</i> (excepting
<i>Cymatophora</i>).<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> The larvæ of the <i>Minores</i> and <i>Quadrifidæ</i>
are as a rule semi-loopers when adult and may be
true loopers when young, although further observations
on this point are wanted. These facts point to the conclusion
that the <i>Noctuæ</i> as a whole are phyletically younger
than the <i>Geometræ</i>, whilst the <i>Genuinæ</i> and <i>Bombyciformes</i>
have further advanced in phyletic development
than the <i>Minores</i> and <i>Quadrifidæ</i>. The last two sections
are therefore the most closely related to the <i>Geometræ</i>, as
correctly shown by the arrangement given in Stainton’s
“Manual;” whilst that adopted in Doubleday’s “Synonymic
List,” where the <i>Geometræ</i> precede the <i>Noctuæ</i>,
is most probably erroneous.</p>

<p><i>Additional descriptions of Sphinx-larvæ.</i>&mdash;In the foregoing
essay on “The Origin of the Markings of Caterpillars,”
Dr. Weismann has paid special attention to the
larvæ of the <i>Sphingidæ</i> and has utilized for this purpose,
in addition to his own studies of the ontogeny of many
European species, the figures in the chief works dealing
with this family published down to the time of appearance
of his essay (1876).<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> In order to amplify this part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">522</a></span>
of the subject I have added references to more recent
descriptions and figures of Sphinx-larvæ published by
Burmeister and A. G. Butler, and I have endeavoured in
these cases to refer the caterpillars as far as possible to
their correct position in the respective groups founded
on the ontogeny and phylogeny of their allies. It is,
however, obvious that for the purposes of this work
figures or descriptions of adult larvæ are of but little
value, except for the comparative morphology of the
markings; and even this branch of the subject only
becomes of true biological importance when viewed in
the light of ontogeny. As our knowledge of the latter
still remains most incomplete in the case of exotic
species, it would be at present premature to attempt to
draw up any genealogy of the whole family, and I will
here only extend the subject by adding some few descriptions
of species which are interesting as having been
made from the observations of field-naturalists, and which
contain remarks on the natural history of the insects.</p>

<p>Mr. C. V. Riley in his “Second Annual Report on
the Noxious, Beneficial, and other Insects of the State of
Missouri, 1870,” gives figures and describes the early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">523</a></span>
stages and adult forms of certain grape-vine feeding
larvæ of the sub-family <i>Chærocampinæ</i>. The full-grown
larva of <i>Philampelus Achemon</i>, Drury, “measures about
3½ inches when crawling, which operation is effected by
a series of sudden jerks. The third segment is the
largest, the second but half its size, and the first still
smaller, and when at rest the two last-mentioned
segments are partly withdrawn into the third.... The
young larva is green, with a long slender reddish horn
rising from the eleventh segment and curving over the
back.” Mr. Riley then states that full grown specimens
are sometimes found as green as the younger ones, but
“they more generally assume a pale straw or reddish-brown
colour, and the long recurved horn is invariably
replaced by a highly polished lenticular tubercle.” The
specimen figured was the pale straw variety, this colour
deepening at the sides, and finally merging into a rich
brown. The markings appear to consist of an interrupted
brown dorsal line, a continuous subdorsal line of the
same colour, and six oblique scalloped white bars along
the side. Whether the colour and marking is adapted
to the vine, as is the case with the two varieties of the
dimorphic <i>Chærocampa Capensis</i> (<i>q.v.</i>), is not stated.
The larva of <i>Philampelus Satellitia</i>, Linn., when newly
hatched, and for some time afterwards is “green with a
tinge of pink along the sides, and with an immensely
long straight pink horn at the tail. This horn soon begins
to shorten, and finally curls round like a dog’s tail.” The
colour of the insect changes to a reddish-brown as it grows
older, and the caudal horn is entirely lost at the third moult.
The chief markings appear to be five oblique cream-yellow
patches with a black annulation on segments 6&ndash;10, and
a pale subdorsal line. The caterpillar crawls by a
series of sudden jerks, and often flings its “head savagely
from side to side when alarmed.” “When at rest, it
draws back the fore part of the body and retracts the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">524</a></span>
head and first two joints into the third.” Two points
in connection with these species are of interest with
respect to the present investigations. The green colour
and the possession of a long caudal horn when young
shows that these larvæ, like those of <i>Chærocampa Elpenor</i>
(p. <a href="#Page_178">178</a>), <i>C. Porcellus</i> (p. <a href="#Page_184">184</a>), and <i>Philampelus Labruscæ</i>
(p. <a href="#Page_195">195</a>, <a href="#Footnote_83">note</a>), are descended from ancestors which possessed
these characters in the adult <span class="locked">state.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a></span> The next
point of interest is the attitude of alarm assumed by these
larvæ, and effected by withdrawing the head and two
front segments into the <span class="locked">third.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></span> The importance of this
in connection with the similar habit of ocellated species
will be seen on reading the remarks on page 367 bearing
upon the initial stages of eye-spots. The other species
figured by Mr. Riley are <i>Chærocampa Pampinatrix</i>,
Smith and Abbot, and <i>Thyreus Abboti</i>, Swains. The
latter has already been referred to (p. <a href="#Page_256">256</a>).</p>

<p>In a paper “On a Collection of Lepidoptera from
Candahar” (Proc. Zoo. Soc., May 4th, 1880), Mr. A. G.
Butler has described and figured, from materials furnished
to him by Major Howland Roberts, the larvæ of
three species of <i>Sphingidæ</i>. <i>Chærocampa Cretica</i>, Boisd.,
feeds on vine; out of 100 specimens examined, there
was not one black variety, while in another closely allied
species, found at Jutogh and Kashmir, the larva is stated
to be as often black as green. The general colour of
the caterpillar harmonizes with that of the underside of
the vine leaves; it possesses a thread-like dorsal, and a
pale yellow subdorsal line; also “a subdorsal row of
eye-spots, each consisting of a green patch in a yellow
oval, the first spot on the fifth segment being the largest
and most distinct, those on each following segment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">525</a></span>
becoming smaller, more flattened, and less distinct, till
lost on the twelfth segment, sometimes becoming
indistinct after the seventh or eighth segment; these
spots are only distinct as eye-spots on the fifth and
sixth segments, that on the sixth being flatter than that
on the fifth, those on the remaining segments appearing
like dashes while the larvæ is green, but more like eyes
on its changing colour when full fed.” The change here
alluded to is the dark-brown coloration so generally
assumed by green Sphinx-larvæ previous to pupation,
and which, as I have stated elsewhere (Proc. Zoo. Soc.,
1873, p. 155), is probably an adaptation advantageous
to such larvæ when crawling over the ground in search
of a suitable place of concealment. Making the necessary
correction for the different mode of counting the
segments, it will be seen that the primary ocelli of this
species are in the same position as those of the other
species of this genus as described in a previous part of
this essay, and that it belongs to the second phyletic
group treated of at p. <a href="#Page_193">193</a>. The interesting fact that
this species does not display dimorphism, whilst the
closely allied form from Kashmir is dimorphic, shows
that in the present species the process of double adaptation
has not taken place; and this will probably be found
to be connected with the habits of life, <i>i.e.</i> the insect
being well adapted to the colour of its food-plant may
not conceal itself on the ground by day. The caterpillar
of <i>Deilephila Robertsi</i>, Butl., is found at Candahar on a
species of <i>Euphorbia</i> growing on the rocky hills, and is
so abundant that at the end of May every plant with any
leaves left on it had several larvæ feeding upon it. “The
larvæ are very beautiful and conspicuous, and are very
different in colouring according to their different stages
of growth.” The general colour is black with white
dots and spots; a subdorsal row of large roundish spots,
one on each segment, either white, yellow, orange or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">526</a></span>
red; dorsal stripe variable in colour, and sometimes
only partially present or altogether absent. “At the
end of May most of the larvæ found presented a different
appearance; the black disappears more or less, and with
it many of the small white spots. In some cases the
black only remains as a ring round the larger white
spots; the ground-colour therefore becomes yellowish-green
or yellow, varying very considerably.” The larva
does not change colour previous to pupation. This
species, according to the outline figure given (<i>loc. cit.</i>,
Pl. XXXIX., Fig. 9), appears to belong to the first of
Dr. Weismann’s groups, comprising <i>D. Euphorbiæ</i>,
<i>D. Dahlii</i> and <i>D. Nicæa</i> (see p. <a href="#Page_199">199</a>), and is therefore in
the seventh phyletic stage of development (p. <a href="#Page_224">224</a>). From
the recorded habits it seems most probable that the
colours and markings of this caterpillar are signals of
distastefulness. It is much to be regretted that Major
Roberts has not increased the value of his description of
this species by adding some observations or experiments
bearing on this point. <i>Eusmerinthus Kindermanni</i>,
Lederer, feeds on willow. “General colour green,
covered with minute white dots and seven long pale yellow
oblique lateral bands. (The ground-colour is
the same as the willow-leaves on which the larva feeds,
the yellow stripes the same as the leaf-stalks, and the
head and true legs like the younger branches).” As no
subdorsal line is mentioned or figured, this species must
be regarded as belonging to the third stage of phyletic
development (see p. <a href="#Page_242">242</a>).</p>

<p>I have recently had an opportunity of inspecting a large
number of drawings of Sphinx-larvæ in the possession
of Mr. F. Moore, and of those species not mentioned in
the previous portions of this work the following may be
noticed:&mdash;<i>Chærocampa Theylia</i>, Linn., like <i>Ch. Lewisii</i>
(note <a href="#Footnote_82">82</a>, p. <a href="#Page_194">194</a>), appears to be another form
connecting the second and third phyletic groups of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">527</a></span>
this genus. <i>Ch. Clotho</i>, Drury, belongs to the third
group (figured by Semper; see note 3 to this Appendix).
The larva of <i>Ch. Lucasii</i>, Walk., offers another instance
of the retention of the subdorsal line by an ocellated
species. The larva of <i>Ch. Lycetus</i>, Cram., of which
Mr. Moore was so good as to show me descriptions made
at the various stages of growth, presents many points of
interest. It belongs to the third phyletic group, and all
the ocelli appear at a very early stage. The dimorphism
appears also in the young larvæ, some being
green, and others black, a fact which may be explained
by the law of “backward transference” (see p. <a href="#Page_274">274</a>). A
most suggestive feature is presented by the caudal horn,
which in the young caterpillar is stated to be <i>freely
movable</i>. It is possible that this horn, which was formerly
possessed by the ancestors of the <i>Sphingidæ</i>, and which
is now retained in many genera, is a remnant of a
flagellate organ having a similar function to the head-tentacles
of the <i>Papilio-larvæ</i>, or to the caudal appendages
of <i>Dicranura</i> (see p. <a href="#Page_289">289</a>).</p>

<p><i>Lophostethus Dumolinii</i>, Angas.&mdash;The larva of this
species differs so remarkably from those of all other
<i>Sphingidæ</i>, that I have thought it of sufficient interest
to publish the following description, kindly furnished by
Mr. Roland Trimen, who in answer to my application
sent the following notes:&mdash;“My knowledge of the very
remarkable larva of this large and curious Smerinthine
Hawk-moth is derived from a photograph by the late
Dr. J. E. Seaman, and from drawings and notes recently
furnished by Mr. W. D. Gooch. The colour is greenish-white,
inclining to grey, and in the male there is a yellow,
but in the female a bluish, tinge in this. All the segments
but the second and the head bear strong black
spines, having a lustre of steel blue, and springing from
a pale yellow tubercular base. The longest of these
spines are in two dorsal rows from the fourth to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">528</a></span>
eleventh segment, the pairs on the fourth and fifth segments
being longer than the rest, very erect, and armed
with short simple prickles for three-fourths of their upper
extremity. The anal horn, which is shorter than the
spines, is of the same character as the latter, being
covered with prickles, and much inclined backwards.
Two lateral rows of similar shorter spines extend from the
fourth to the 12th segment, and on each of the segments
6&ndash;11 the space between the upper and lower spines
is marked with a conspicuous pale yellow spot. Two
rows of smaller similar spines extend on each side (below
the two rows of larger ones) from the second to the
thirteenth segment, one spine of the lowermost row being
on the fleshy base of each pro-leg. All the pro-legs are
white close to the base, and russet-brown beyond.
Head smooth, unarmed in adult, greenish-white with two
longitudinal russet-brown stripes on face.</p>

<p>“The young larvæ have proportionally much longer and
more erect spines with distinct long prickles on them.
There is a short pair besides, either on the back of the
head or on the second segment. Moreover, the dorsal
spines of the third and fourth segments, and the anal
horn (which is quite erect, and the longest of all), are
longer than the rest, and distinctly <i>forked</i> at their
extremity.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gooch notes that these young larvæ might readily
be mistaken for those of the <i>Acrææ</i>, and suggests that
this may protect them. He also states that the yellow
lateral spots are only noticed after the last moult before
pupation, and that the general resemblance of the larva
as regards colour is to the faded leaves of its food-plant,
a species of <i>Dombeia</i>.”</p>

<p>The forked caudal horn in the young larva of this
species is of interest in connection with the similar
character of this appendage in the young caterpillar of
<i>Hyloicus Pinastri</i>, p. <a href="#Page_265">265</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">529</a></span></p>

<p><i>Retention of the Subdorsal Line by Ocellated Larvæ.</i>&mdash;It
has already been shown with reference to the eye-spots
of the <i>Chærocampa</i>-larvæ, that these markings have been
developed from the subdorsal line, and that, in accordance
with their function as a means of causing terror, this line
has in most species been eliminated in the course of the
phylogeny from those segments bearing the eye-spots
in order to give full effect to the latter (see p. <a href="#Page_379">379</a>). In
accordance with the law that a character when it has
become useless gradually disappears, the subdorsal is
more or less absent in all those species in which the ocelli
are most perfectly developed; and it can be readily
imagined that in cases where adaptation to the foliage
exists the suppression of this line would under certain
conditions be accelerated by natural selection. On the
other hand, it is conceivable that the subdorsal line may
under other conditions be of use to a protectively
coloured ocellated species by imitating some special
part of the food-plant, under which circumstances its
retention would be secured by natural selection.</p>

<p>Such an instance is offered by <i>Chærocampa Capensis</i>,
Linn.; and as this case is particularly instructive as likewise
throwing light upon the retention of the subdorsal
by certain species having oblique stripes (see p. <a href="#Page_377">377</a>, and
note <a href="#Footnote_166">166</a>, p. <a href="#Page_378">378</a>), I will here give some details concerning
this species which have been communicated to me
by Mr. Roland Trimen, the well-known curator of the
South African Museum, Cape Town. The caterpillar of
<i>C. Capensis</i>, like so many other species of the genus, is
dimorphic, one form being a bright (rather pale) green,
and the other, which is much the rarer of the two, being
dull pinkish-red. Both these forms are adapted in colour to
the vine on which they feed, the red variety according to
some extent with the faded leaves of the cultivated vines,
but to a greater extent with the young shoots and underside
of the leaves of the South African native vine (<i>Cissus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">530</a></span>
Capensis</i>), on which it also feeds. There are two
eye-spots in this species in the usual positions; they are
described as being blue-grey in a white ring, and raised so
as to project a little. The subdorsal is white, and is bordered
beneath by a wide shade of bluish-green irrorated
with white dots, and crossed by an indistinct white
oblique ray on each segment. These last markings are
probably remnants of an oblique striping formerly
possessed by the progenitor of this and other species of
the genus (see, for instance, Fig. 25, <a href="#Plate_IV">Pl. IV</a>., one of the
young stages of <i>C. Porcellus</i>). It is possible that these
rudimentary oblique stripes are now of service in assisting
the adaptation of the larva to its food-plant, but this
cannot be decided without seeing the insect <i>in situ</i>.</p>

<p>The subdorsal line extends from immediately behind
the second eye-spot to the base of the very short and
much curved violet anal horn. With reference to the
protective colouring Mr. Trimen writes:&mdash;“The difficulty
of seeing these large and beautifully-coloured larvæ on the
vines is quite surprising; six or more may be well within
sight, and yet quite unnoticed. The subdorsal stripe
greatly aids in their concealment, as it well represents in
its artificial light and shade the leaf-stalks of the vine.”
When this larva withdraws its front segments the eye-spots
stand out very menacingly; but in spite of this it is
greedily eaten by fowls and shrikes (<i>Fiscus Collaris</i>),
and Mr. Trimen also found that a tame suricate
(<i>Rhyzæna Suricata</i>) and a large monitor lizard (<i>Regenia
Albogularis</i>) did not refuse them. The failure of the
eye-spots in causing terror in these particular cases cannot
be regarded as disproving their utility in all instances. It
must always be borne in mind that no protective
character can possibly be of service against <i>all</i> foes;
natural selection only requires that such characters should
be advantageous with respect to the majority of the
enemies of any species, and further experiments with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">531</a></span>
this caterpillar may show that in the case of smaller foes
the eye-spots are effective as a means of causing alarm.
The dimorphism of the larva of <i>C. Capensis</i> is of special
interest, although we are not yet sufficiently acquainted
with the habits of this species to offer a complete explanation.
According to Dr. Weismann’s conclusions
(p. <a href="#Page_297">297</a>), the dimorphism of the <i>Chærocampa</i>-larvæ is due
to a double adaptation, the insects first having acquired
the habit of concealing themselves by day, and the dark
form having then been produced by the action of natural
selection, in order to adapt such varieties to the colour
of the soil, whilst others retained the green colour which
adapts them to the foliage of their food-plants. In
accordance with this, <i>C. Capensis</i> may have a similar
habit of concealment, or (should this be found not to be
the case) it is possible that this insect at a former period
possessed this habit and fed upon some other plant, when
it would have become dimorphic in the manner explained,
and the <i>existing</i> dimorphism may be a survival of the
more ancient dimorphism, the red form (corresponding
to the older dark form) having been subsequently modified
so as to become also adapted to the new food-plant.
Much light would be thrown upon this by studying the
ontogeny of the species.</p>

<p><i>Phytophagic Variability.</i>&mdash;A number of observations
bearing on the phytophagic variability of the Sphinx-larvæ
and other caterpillars have been recorded in a
previous <a href="#Footnote_140">note</a> (p. <a href="#Page_305">305</a>), and reference has also been made
to the food-plants of <i>Acherontia Atropos</i> in South Africa
(note <a href="#Footnote_121">121</a>, p. <a href="#Page_263">263</a>). I am now enabled to add some
further observations on this species, from notes furnished
to me by Mr. Roland Trimen, who states that for many
years he has noticed that at the Cape this larva varies
greatly in the depth and shade of the green ground-colour,
the variability being in strict accordance with the
colour of the leaves of the particular plant on which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">532</a></span>
individual feeds. The phenomenon was particularly
noticeable in larvæ feeding on <i>Buxia Grandiflora</i>, a
shrub in common cultivation in gardens, and of which
the foliage is of a very dull pale greyish-green. Another
striking instance was noticed in some very fine caterpillars
feeding on a large shrubby <i>Solanum</i>, which, excepting
the bright yellow bands bordering the dorsal violet bars,
were generally dull ochreous-yellow, like the leaves and
stalks of the <i>Solanum</i>. On plants with bright green or
deep green leaves, the colour of the larvæ is almost in
exact agreement. Mr. Trimen adds:&mdash;“These remarks
apply principally to the underside and pro-legs and
lower lateral regions, the dorsal colours of violet and
yellow varying but little. The protection afforded is
very considerable, as the larvæ almost always cling to
the lower side of the twigs of their food-plants, so
that their uniformly-coloured under-surface is upwards,
and turned towards the light, and their variegated upper
surface turned downwards.”</p>

<p>These observations are of the highest importance, not
only as adding another instance to the recorded cases
of phytophagic variation, but likewise as showing that
with this variability a protective habit has been acquired.
It is to be hoped that such a promising field for experimental
investigation as is offered by this and analogous
cases will not long remain unexplored. In attacking the
problem two chief questions have in the first place to be
settled: (1) Is the variability truly phytophagic, <i>i.e.</i> are
the colour variations actually brought about by the
chemico-physiological action of the food-plant? and
(2) Are the larvæ at any period of growth susceptible to
the action of phytophagic influences? The first question
could be decided by feeding larvæ from the same batch
of eggs on different food-plants from the period of their
hatching. The second question could be settled by
changing the food-plants of a series of selected specimens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">533</a></span>
at various stages of growth, and observing whether any
change of colour was produced. In accordance with the
principles advocated in a previous <a href="#Footnote_140">note</a> (p. <a href="#Page_305">305</a>), it is
conceivable <i>à priori</i> that phytophagic variability may
occur by direct chemico-physiological action, quite
irrespective of any of the changes of colour being of
protective use. In the case of brightly-coloured distasteful
species phytophagic variability might thus have
full play, but in the case of protectively-coloured edible
species, phytophagic variability would be under the
control of natural selection. These considerations raise
a question of the greatest theoretical interest in connection
with this phenomenon. If phytophagic variability
can have full play uncontrolled by natural selection
in brightly-coloured caterpillars, ought not this
phenomenon to be of more common occurrence in such
species than in those protectively coloured? Although
our knowledge of this subject is still very imperfect, as
a matter of fact brightly coloured larvæ, so far as I have
been able to ascertain, do not appear to be susceptible
of phytophagic influences. But this apparent contradiction,
instead of opposing actually confirms the foregoing
views, as will appear on further consideration.
The colours of protected species are as a whole much
inferior in brilliancy to those of inedible species, so that
any phytophagic effect would be more perceptible in the
former than in the latter, in which the highest possible
standard of brilliancy appears in most cases to have been
attained. Now phytophagic variations of colour appear
to be of but small amount, or, in other words, such
variations fluctuate within comparatively restricted limits,
and as the cases at present known are mostly <i>adaptive</i>
it is legitimate to conclude that they have been produced
and brought to their present standard by natural
selection, <i>i.e.</i> that they have arisen from phytophagic
influences as a cause of variability. The initial stages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">534</a></span>
of phytophagic variations must therefore have been still
less perceptible than the now perfected final results; and
this leads to the conclusion that minute variations of
this character were of sufficient importance to protectively-coloured
species to be taken advantage of by
natural selection. But minute variations in a dull-coloured
larva would, as previously pointed out, produce
a comparatively much greater effect than such variations
in a brilliantly-coloured species; and as protection is
required by the former, the initial phytophagic effects
would be accumulated, and the power of adaptability
conferred by the continued action of natural selection,
whilst in vividly-coloured species where no power of
adaptability is required this cause of variation would not
only produce a result which, as compared with its effects
upon dull species, may be regarded as a “vanishing
quantity,” but this result would be too insignificant to
be taken advantage of by natural selection, which is in
these cases dealing only with large “quantities,” and
striving to make the caterpillars as brilliant as possible.
The fact that vividly-coloured distasteful larvæ do not
show phytophagic variation is to my mind explained
proximately by these considerations; the ultimate cause
of phytophagic variability regarded as a chemico-physiological
action requires further investigation.</p>

<p><i>Sexual Variation in Larvæ.</i>&mdash;Since most of the markings
of caterpillars can be explained by the two factors
of adaptation and inheritance, or, in other words, by their
present and past relations to the environment, and since
sexual selection can have played no direct part in producing
these colours and markings, I feel bound to record
here some few observations on the sexual differences
in larvæ in addition to the cases of <i>Anapæa</i> and
<i>Orgyia</i> already recorded (note <a href="#Footnote_141">i.</a>, p. <a href="#Page_308">308</a>) and of
<i>Lophostethus Dumolinii</i> (p. <a href="#Page_527">527</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">535</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. C. V. Riley <span class="locked">states<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a></span> with reference to the larva
of <i>Thyreus Abboti</i> that the ground-colour appears to
depend upon the sex, Dr. Morris having described the
insect as “reddish-brown with numerous patches of
light green,” and having expressly stated that “the
<i>female</i> is of a uniform reddish-brown with an interrupted
dark-brown dorsal line and transverse striæ.” Mr.
W. D. Gooch, who has reared the South African butterflies

<h4 id="P2-A2">APPENDIX II.</h4>

<p>The following paper by Dr. Fritz Müller<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> forms the
third of a series of communications on Brazilian butterflies
published in “Kosmos,” and as it bears upon the
investigations made known in the third essay of the
present work, I will here give a translation, by permission
of the publisher, Herr Karl Alberts.</p>

<h5>“<span class="smcap">Acræa and the Maracujá Butterflies as
Larvæ, Pupæ, and Imagines.</span></h5>

<p>“In a thoughtful essay on ‘Phyletic Parallelism in
Metamorphic Species,’ Weismann has shown that in the
case of Lepidoptera the developmental stages of larva,
pupa, and imago vary independently, and that a change
occurring in one stage is without influence upon the preceding
and succeeding stages, so that the course which
has been followed by the individual stages in their
developmental history has not been in all cases identical.
This want of agreement may manifest itself both by
unequal divergence of form-relationship, and by unequal
group formation. With respect to unequal form-divergence
the caterpillars are sometimes more closely related
in form than their imagines, and at other times the reverse
is the case. With respect to unequal group formation
again, two cases are possible; the larvæ and imagines
may form groups of unequal value, the one stage forming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">537</a></span>
higher or lower groups than the other, or they may
form groups of unequal size, <i>i.e.</i>, groups which do not
coincide but which overlap. Form-relationship and
blood-relationship do not therefore always agree; the
resemblances among the caterpillars would lead to a quite
different arrangement to that resulting from the resemblances
among the imagines, and it is probable that
neither of these arrangements would correspond with
the actual relationships.</p>

<p>“Starting from this fact, which he establishes by
numerous examples, Weismann proceeds to show most
convincingly that an innate power of development or of
transformation, such as has been assumed under various
names by many adherents of the development theory,
has no existence, but that every modification and advancement
in species has been called forth by external
influences.</p>

<p>“A most beautiful illustration of the want of ‘phyletic
parallelism,’ as Weismann designates the different form-relationships
of the larvæ, pupæ, and imagines, is furnished
by the five genera <i>Acræa</i>, <i>Heliconius</i>, <i>Eueides</i>,
<i>Colænis</i>, and <i>Dione</i> (= <i>Agraulis</i>). This instance seems
to me to be of especial value, because it offers the rare
case of pupæ showing greater differences than the larvæ
and imagines.</p>

<p>“The species of which I observed the larvæ and pupæ
are <i>Acræa Thalia</i> and <i>Alalia</i>, <i>Heliconius Eucrate</i>, <i>Eueides
Isabella</i>, <i>Colænis Dido</i> and <i>Julia</i>, <i>Dione Vanillæ</i> and
<i>Juno</i>; besides these I noticed the pupa of <i>Eueides
Aliphera</i>.</p>

<p>“The following remarks apply only to these species,
although we may suppose with great probability that the
whole of the congeneric forms&mdash;excepting perhaps the
widely ranging species of <i>Acræa</i>&mdash;would display similar
characters to their Brazilian representatives.</p>

<p>“The imagines of the five genera mentioned form two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">538</a></span>
sharply defined families, the <i>Acræidæ</i> and the butterflies
of the Maracujá <span class="locked">group.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></span> The latter comprises the three
genera <i>Heliconius</i>, <i>Eueides</i>, and <i>Colænis</i>, which differ
only in very unimportant characters; <i>Eueides</i> is distinguished
from <i>Heliconius</i> by its shorter antennæ, and
<i>Colænis</i> differs from <i>Eueides</i> in having the discoidal cell
of the hind-wings open. The genus <i>Dione</i> is further
removed by the different structure of the legs, and the
silvery spots on the underside of the wings. Certain
species resemble those of other genera in a most striking
manner, and much more closely both in colour and
marking, and even in the form of their wings, than they
do their own congeners. This is the case with <i>Acræa
Thalia</i> and <i>Eueides Pavana</i>, with <i>Heliconius Eucrate</i> and
<i>Eueides Isabella</i>, and with <i>Eueides Aliphera</i> and <i>Colænis
Julia</i>, which are deceptively alike, and the last two are
connected with <i>Dione Juno</i>, at least by the upper side of
the wings. The difficulty of judging of the relationships
of the single species is thus much aggravated; it cannot
be said how much of this resemblance is to be attributed
to blood-relationship, and how much to deceptive
imitation.</p>

<p>“As larvæ all the Brazilian species must be placed <i>in
one genus</i>, as they agree exactly in the number and
arrangement of their spines (4 spines, not in a transverse
row, on segments 2 and 3; 6 spines, in a transverse row,
on segments 4&ndash;11; 4 spines, not in a transverse row,
on the last (12th) segment). They differ from one
another much less in this respect than do the German
species of <i>Vanessa</i>, such, for instance, as <i>V. Io</i> or <i>Antiopa</i>
from <i>V. Polychloros</i>, <i>Urticæ</i>, and <i>Atalanta</i>.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> The larvæ
of <i>Acræa Thalia</i> are certainly without the two spines on
the head which the others possess, and, on the other
hand, they have a well-developed pair of spines on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">539</a></span>
first segment, which, in most of the other species, are
completely absent; but this does not justify their
separation, since the head spines of <i>Heliconius</i>, <i>Eueides</i>,
and <i>Colænis Dido</i>, which are of a considerable length,
are shorter than those of the next segment in <i>Colænis
Julia</i>, and <i>Dione Vanillæ</i>, and in <i>Dione Juno</i> they
dwindle down to two minute points, this last species also
bearing a short pair on the first segment. The larva of
<i>Dione Juno</i> is thus as closely related to that of <i>Acræa
Thalia</i> as it is to that of its congener <i>Dione Vanillæ</i>.</p>

<p>“If it were desired to form two distinct larval groups
this could not be effected on the basis of their differences
in form, but could only be based on their food-plants.
The larvæ of <i>Heliconius</i>, <i>Eueides</i>, <i>Colænis</i>, and
<i>Dione</i> live on species of Maracujá (Passiflora); those of
<i>Acræa Thalia</i> and <i>Alalia</i> on Compositæ (<i>Mikania</i> and
<i>Veronia</i>). These larval groups would agree with those
founded on the form-relationships of the imagines, but
unlike the imaginal groups, which can be formed into
families, they would scarcely possess a generic value.</p>

<p>“If we arrange the single species of caterpillars according
to their resemblances, this arrangement does not
agree with that based on the resemblances of the
imagines, even if we disregard the different values of the
groups. The result is somewhat as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>[Here follow the remarks on the habits of the larvæ
in connection with their colours, &amp;c., which have already
been quoted in illustration of the use of the spiny protection
(note <a href="#Footnote_133">133</a>, p. <a href="#Page_293">293</a>). From these facts the author
draws the conclusion that the form-relationships of the
caterpillars depend rather upon their mode of life than
upon their blood-relationships, assuming the latter to be
correctly expressed by the arrangement of the imagines
at present adopted.]</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><p>Figs. 1&ndash;4. Pupæ of <i>Acræa Thalia</i>; <i>Heliconius Eucrate</i>; <i>Eueides
Isabella</i>, and <i>Colænis Dido</i>; life size.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“A glance at the above figures of the pupæ of <i>Heliconius
Eucrate</i> (Fig. 2), <i>Eueides Isabella</i> (Fig. 3), and
<i>Colænis Dido</i> (Fig. 4), will show how great are the
differences between these pupæ as compared with the
close form-relationship of all the Maracujá butterflies,
and with the no less close resemblance of their larvæ.
A family which comprised three such dissimilar pupæ
would also be capable of including that of <i>Acræa
Thalia</i> (Fig. 1).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">541</a></span></p>

<p>“The pupa of this last species has nothing peculiar in its
general appearance, but possesses the ordinary pupal
form; it is tolerably rounded, without any great elevations
or depressions; a minute pointed projection is
situated on the head over each eye-cover, and a similar
process projects from the roots of the wings. Its distinguishing
characters are five pairs of spines on the
back of the abdominal segments. These spines are found
also in <i>Acræa Alalia</i>, but appear to be absent in other
species, <i>e.g.</i> in the Indian <i>A. Violæ</i>. Last summer,
among some batches of <i>Thalia</i> larvæ&mdash;each batch being
the progeny from one lot of eggs&mdash;I found certain individuals
which differed from the others in having much
shorter spines, and these changed into pupæ in which
the five pairs of spines were proportionally shorter than
usual, thus being an exception to the rule that changes
in one stage of development are without influence on
the other stages. I may remark, by the way, that this law,
enunciated by Weismann, can only be applied to imagines
and pupæ with certain restrictions. The skin of the pupa
forms a sheath or cover for the eyes, antennæ, trunk,
legs, and wings of the imago, and if these parts undergo
any considerable modification in the latter, corresponding
changes must appear in the pupa. This is shown, for
instance, by many ‘Skippers’ (<i>Hesperidæ</i>), in which the
extraordinarily long trunk necessitates a sheath of a
corresponding length. The colour of the pupa of <i>Acræa
Thalia</i> is whitish, the wing-veins with some other
markings and the spines are black; metallic spots are
absent.</p>

<p>“In the pupa of <i>Heliconius Eucrate</i> the laterally compressed
region of the wings is raised into a large projection,
the antennal sheaths lying on the edges of the
wings are serrated and beset with short pointed spines;
instead of the minute projections of <i>Acræa Thalia</i>, the
head bears two large humped processes; the body is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">542</a></span>
raised on each side into a foliaceous border carrying five
spines of different lengths, the foremost pair, directed
towards the head, being the longest. The pupa is brown,
and ornamented with four pairs of brilliant metallic
spots, one pair close behind the antennæ, and three
pairs, almost coalescent, on the back before the longest
pair of spines. A short spine projects from the
middle of each of the latter somewhat arched metallic
patches.</p>

<p>“In the pupa of <i>Colænis Dido</i> (which resembles that
of <i>Colænis Julia</i>, and to which may be added those of
<i>Dione Vanillæ</i> and <i>Juno</i>) the spines are absent, the wing
region is but moderately arched, and the antennæ
marked only by small elevations; instead of the leaf-like
border, there are on each side of the back five knotty
or humped processes. The metallic spots are similar in
number and position to those of <i>Heliconius Eucrate</i>;
those on the back have a wart-like process in the
middle, instead of a spine.</p>

<p>“The pupæ of <i>Heliconius</i> and <i>Colænis</i> when moving
their posterior segments rapidly, as they do whenever
they are disturbed, produce a very perceptible hissing
noise by the friction of these segments, this sound, which
is especially noticeable in the case of <i>Heliconius Eucrate</i>,
perhaps serving to terrify small foes. (So loud is the
sound produced in this manner by the pupæ of <i>Epicalia
Numilia</i>, that my children have named them ‘<i>Schreipuppen</i>.’)</p>

<p>“The pupæ of <i>Heliconius</i> and <i>Colænis</i> thus differ to a
much greater extent than the imagines or larvæ, and
the same holds good for <i>Eueides</i> in a much higher
degree as compared with its above-mentioned allies.
The larvæ of <i>Eueides</i> have no distinctive characters, and
even the generic rank of the imagines is doubtful; as
pupæ, on the other hand, they are far removed (even by
their mode of suspension) not only from the remainder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">543</a></span>
of the Maracujá group and from the whole of the great
Nymphalideous group (<i>Danainæ</i>, <i>Satyrinæ</i>, <i>Elymniinæ</i>,
<i>Brassolinæ</i>, <i>Morphinæ</i>, <i>Acræinæ</i> and <i>Nymphalinæ</i>), but
from almost all other butterflies. The larva pupates on the
underside of a leaf; the pupa is fastened by the tail,
but does not hang down like the pupæ of the other
<i>Nymphalidæ</i>,&mdash;its last segments are so curved that the
breast of the chrysalis is in contact with the underside
of the leaf. I am not acquainted with any other pupa
among those not suspended by a girdle which assumes
such a position. Something similar occurs, however, in
the pupa of <i>Stalachtis</i>, which is without a girdle, and
according to Bates, is ‘kept in an inclined position by
the fastening of the tail.’ By this peculiarity Bates
distinguishes the <i>Stalachtinæ</i> from the <i>Libytheæ</i> with
pupæ ‘freely suspended by the tail.’</p>

<p>“Besides through this peculiar position of the body,
the pupa of <i>Eueides Isabella</i> is distinguished by short
hooked and long narrow sabre-like pairs of processes on
the back and head. Its colour is whitish, yellowish,
or sordid yellowish-grey; in the last variety both the
four long dorsal processes and the surrounding portions,
as well as the points of the other processes, remain
white or yellowish. The pupa <i>Eueides Aliphera</i> is very
similar, only all the processes are somewhat shorter, the
four longest (dorsal) and some other markings being
black.</p>

<p>“Now if, as Weismann has attempted to show for
larvæ and imagines, the form-divergence always ‘corresponds
exactly with the divergence in the mode of life,’
the question arises as to what difference in the conditions
of life has brought about such a considerable form-divergence
between the pupæ of such closely allied species
as the Maracujá butterflies. In pupæ which do not eat
or drink, and which have neither to seek in courtship nor
to care for progeny, it is only protection from foes that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">544</a></span>
can concern us. But in the pupæ of nearly allied species
of which the larvæ feed on kindred plants in the same
districts at the same periods of the year, can the enemies
be so different as to produce such a considerable divergence
in form? One might answer this question in the
negative with some confidence, and affirm that in this
case the difference in the pupæ does not result from
the ‘divergence in the mode of life,’ or from the difference
in the external conditions, but is accidental,
<i>i.e.</i> a consequence of some fortunate variation induced
by some external cause, which variation afforded protection
against common foes&mdash;to one species in one
way, and to the other species in some other way; this
course, once entered upon, having been urged on by
natural selection, until at length the wide divergence
now shown is attained. How in the case of any of
the species the peculiarity in colour or form can actually
serve as a protection, I must confess myself at fault in
answering. Only in the case of the pupa of <i>Eueides
Isabella</i> will I venture to offer a supposition. That it
is not green like other pupæ which suspend themselves
among foliage (<i>Siderone</i>, <i>Epicalia,</i> <i>Callidryas</i>, &amp;c.), but
contrasts more or less brightly with the dark green of
the leaves, precludes the idea of concealment; on the
other hand its colour is too dull to serve as a conspicuous
sign of distastefulness. In either case the meaning of
the wonderful processes of the pupa would remain unexplained.</p>

<p>“We are thus compelled to seek another possibility in
mimicry, by which foes would be deceived by deceptive
resemblance. But what is the object imitated? Dead
insects overgrown by fungi are often found on leaves,
the whitish or yellowish fungi growing from their bodies
in various fantastic forms. Such insects of course no longer
serve as tempting morsels. The processes of the pupa of
<i>Eueides</i> suggest such fungoid growths, although I certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">545</a></span>
cannot assert that to our eyes in broad daylight the
resemblance is very striking. But the pupæ hang among
the shadows of the leaves, and a less perfect imitation
may deceive foes that are not so sharp-sighted; protective
resemblance must commence moreover with an
imperfect degree of imitation.”</p>

<span class="subhead">THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE MEXICAN AXOLOTL
INTO AMBLYSTOMA.</span></h3>

<h4 id="P3-Intro">INTRODUCTION.</h4>

<p>Since the time when Duméril made known the
transformation of a number of Axolotls into the
so-called Amblystoma form, this Mexican Amphibian
has been bred in many European aquaria,
chiefly with the view to establish the conditions
under which this transformation occurred, so as to
be enabled to draw further conclusions as to the
true causes of this exceptional and enigmatical
metamorphosis.</p>

<p>Although the Amphibians propagated freely,
the cases in which transformation occurred remained
extremely rare, and it was not once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">556</a></span>
possible to reply to the main question, viz.
whether this metamorphosis was determined by
external conditions or by purely internal causes;
to say nothing of the possibility of there perhaps
being discoverable certain definite external influences
by means of which the metamorphosis
could have been induced with certainty. But
while these points are undecided all attempted
theoretical interpretations of the phenomenon
must be devoid of a solid basis.</p>

<p>It appeared to me from the first that the history
of this transformation of the Axolotl was of
special theoretical value; indeed I believed that
it might possibly furnish a special case for deciding
the truth of those ground-principles,
according to which the origin of this species is
represented by the two conflicting schools as a
case of transformation or as one of heterogenesis.
I therefore determined to make some experiments
with the Axolotl myself, in the hopes of being
fortunate enough to be able to throw some light
upon the subject.</p>

<p>In the year 1872 Prof. v. Kölliker was so good
as to leave with me five specimens of his Axolotls,
bred in Würzburg, and these furnished a numerous
progeny in the following year. With these I
carried out the idea, the theoretical bearing of
which will be shown subsequently, whether it
would not be possible to force all the larvæ, or
at any rate, the greater majority, to undergo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">557</a></span>
transformation by exposing them to conditions of
life which made the use of gills difficult, and that
of lungs more easy; in other words, by compelling
them to live partly on land at a certain
stage of life.</p>

<p>During that year indeed I obtained no results,
most of the larvæ perishing before the time for
such an experiment had arrived, and the few
survivors did not undergo transformation, but
lived on to the following spring and then also
died one after the other. Through long absence
from Freiburg, necessitated by other labours, I
had evidently left them without sufficient care
and attention. I was thus led to the conviction,
which was more fully confirmed subsequently,
that no results can be obtained without the
greatest care and attention in rearing, towards
which single object all one’s interest should be
concentrated, and it must not be considered
irksome to have to devote daily for many months
a large amount of time to this experiment. As
it was evident that I could not afford this time
without calling in other aid, I hailed with pleasure
an opportunity of witnessing the experiment performed
by other hands.</p>

<p>A lady living here (Freiburg), Fräulein v.
Chauvin, undertook to rear a number of my larvæ
of the following year which had just hatched, and
in accordance with my idea to make the experiment
of forcibly compelling them to adopt the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">558</a></span>
Amblystoma form. How completely this was
accomplished will be seen from the following
notes by the lady herself, and it will no less
appear that these results were only obtained by
that care in treatment and delicacy of observation
which she devoted to the experiments.</p>

<h4>EXPERIMENTS.</h4>

<p>“I began the experiments on June 12th, 1874,
with five larvæ about eight days old, these being
the only survivors out of twelve. Owing to the
extraordinary delicacy of these creatures, the
quality and temperature of the water, and the
nature and quantity of their food exerts the greatest
influence, especially in early life, and one cannot
be too cautious in their treatment.</p>

<p>“The specimens were kept in a glass globe of
about thirty centimeters in diameter, the temperature
of the water being regulated; as food at
first Daphnids, and afterwards larger aquatic
animals were introduced in large numbers. By
this means all the five larvæ throve excellently.
At the end of June the rudiments of the front
legs appeared in the most vigorous specimens,
and on the 9th of July the hind legs also became
visible. At the end of November I noticed that
one Axolotl remained constantly at the surface of
the water, and this led me to suppose that the
right period had now arrived for effecting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">559</a></span>
transformation into Amblystoma. For brevity I
shall designate this as No. I., and the succeeding
specimens by corresponding Roman numerals.</p>

<p>“In order to bring about this metamorphosis,
on December 1st, 1874, No. I. was placed in a
large-sized glass vessel containing earth arranged
in such a manner that, when the vessel was filled
with water, only one portion of the surface of the
earth was entirely covered by the liquid, and the
creature in the course of its frequent perigrinations
was thus more or less exposed to the air. The
water was gradually diminished on the following
days, during which period the first changes made
their appearance in the Amphibian&mdash;<i>the gills
commenced to shrivel up</i>, and at the same time
the creature showed a tendency to seek the
shallowest spots. On December 4th, it took
entirely to the land, and concealed itself among
some damp moss which I had placed on a heap
of sand on the highest portion of the earth in the
glass vessel. At this period the first ecdysis
occurred. Within the four days from the 1st to
the 4th of December, a striking change took
place in the external appearance of No. I., the gill-tufts
shrivelled up almost entirely, the dorsal
crest completely disappeared, and the tail, which
had hitherto been broad, became rounded and
similarly formed to that of a land salamander.
The grey-brown colour of the body changed gradually
into a blackish hue; isolated spots, at first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">560</a></span>
of a dull white, made their appearance and these in
time increased in intensity.</p>

<p>“When the Axolotl left the water on December
4th the gill-clefts were still open, but these closed
gradually, and after about eight days were overgrown
with skin and no longer to be seen.</p>

<p>“Of the other larvæ three appeared at the end
of November (<i>i.e.</i> at the same time when No. I.
came to the surface of the water) to have kept
pace in development with No. I., an indication
that for these also the right period had arrived for
accelerating the developmental processes. They
were therefore submitted to the same treatment as
No. I. No. II. became transformed at the same
time and exactly in the same manner as the latter;
its gill-tufts were complete when it was first placed
in the shallow water, but after four days these had
almost entirely disappeared; in the course of about
ten days after it took to the land, the overgrowth
of skin on the gill-clefts and the complete assumption
of the salamander form occurred. During
this last period the creature took food, but only
when urged to do so.</p>

<p>“In Nos. III. and IV. the development proceeded
more slowly. Neither of these so frequently
sought the shallow spots, nor did they as a rule
remain so long exposed to the air, so that the
greater part of January had expired before they
took entirely to the land. Nevertheless the dessication
of the gill-tufts did not take a longer time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">561</a></span>
than in Nos. I. and II. as the first ecdysis occurred
as soon as they took to the land.</p>

<p>“No. V. showed still more striking deviations in
its transformation than Nos. III. and IV., but as
this specimen appeared much weaker than the
others from the beginning and was retarded in
growth to a most notable extent, this is by no
means surprising. It took fourteen instead of four
days before the transformation had advanced far
enough to enable it to leave the water. It was
especially interesting to observe the behaviour of
this specimen during this period. Its weak and
delicate constitution evidently made it much more
susceptible to all external influences than the others.
If exposed to the air for too long a time it acquired
a light colour, and when annoyed or alarmed it
emitted a peculiar odour, similar to that of a
salamander. As soon as these phenomena were
observed it was at once placed in deeper water, into
which it immediately plunged and gradually recovered
itself, the gills always becoming again
expanded. The same experiment was repeated
several times and always led to the same
result, from which we may venture to conclude
that by accelerating the transformation
too energetically, the process may come to a
standstill, and even by continued compulsion may
end in death.</p>

<p>“It yet remains to be mentioned with respect to
Axolotl No. V. that this specimen, unlike all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">562</a></span>
others, did not emerge from the water at the first
ecdysis, but at the time of the fourth.</p>

<p>“All the Axolotls are now (July, 1875) living,
and are healthy and vigorous, so that with respect
to their state of nourishment there is nothing to
prevent their propagating. Of the first four the
largest is fifteen centim. long; Axolotl No. V.
measures twelve centim.</p>

<p>“The preceding statements appear to demonstrate
the correctness of the views advanced in the
Introduction:&mdash;Axolotl larvæ generally but not
always complete their metamorphosis if, in the
first place, they emerge sound from the egg and
are properly fed; and if, in the next place, they are
submitted to the necessary treatment for changing
aquatic into aërial respiration. It is obvious that
this treatment must only be applied very gradually,
and in such a manner as not to overtax the vital
energy of the Amphibian.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>To the foregoing remarks of Fräulein v. Chauvin
I may add that in all five cases the transformation
was complete, and not to be confounded with that
change which occurs more or less in all Axolotls
in the course of time when confined in small glass
vessels. In this last case there frequently appear
changes in the direction of the Amblystoma form
without the latter being actually reached. In the
five adult Axolotls which I possessed for a short
time, and of which two were at least four years old,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">563</a></span>
the gills were much shrivelled, but the aquatic tail
and dorsal crest were unchanged. The crest may,
however, also disappear, and the tail become
shortened without these changes being due to a
transformation into Amblystoma, as will be shown
further on.</p>

<p>With respect to the duration of the transformation,
this amounted in Axolotls Nos. I. to IV.
altogether to twelve or fourteen days. Of these,
four days were taken by the first changes which
occurred while the creature was still in the water;
the remaining time, to the completion of the metamorphosis,
was passed on land. Duméril gives
the duration of the metamorphosis as sixteen
days.</p>

<p>The following results of the experiments just described
appear to me to be especially noteworthy:&mdash;The
five Axolotl larvæ which can alone be taken
into consideration, the others having soon perished,
all experienced metamorphosis, and without an exception
became Amblystomas. Only one of them,
No. I., by persistently swimming at the surface,
as was observed at the end of six months, showed
a decided tendency to undergo metamorphosis
and to adopt aërial respiration. With respect to
this specimen it may therefore be confidently
assumed that it would have taken to the land, and
that metamorphosis would have occurred without
artificial aid, just as was the case in the thirty
specimens which Duméril altogether observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">564</a></span></p>

<p>Respecting Nos. II., III., and IV., on the other
hand, such a supposition is but little probable.
These three larvæ endeavoured to keep in deep
water and avoided as long as possible the shallow
places which would have enforced them to take
entirely to lung breathing. Metamorphosis thus
occurred more than a month later in these
individuals.</p>

<p>Finally, there can scarcely be any doubt that
No. V. would not have become transformed without
forcible adaptation to an aërial life.</p>

<p>From these results we may venture to conclude
that most Axolotl larvæ change into the Amblystoma
form when, at the age of six to nine months,
they are placed in such shallow water that they are
compelled to respire chiefly by their lungs. The
experiments before us are certainly at present but
very few in number, but such a conclusion cannot
be termed premature if we consider that out of
several hundred Axolotls (the exact number is not
given) Duméril obtained only about thirty Amblystomas,
while v. Kölliker bred only one Amblystoma
out of a hundred Axolotls.</p>

<p>It now only remains questionable whether <i>each
larva</i> could have been forced to undergo metamorphosis,
but this could only be decided by new
experiments. It was originally my intention to
have delayed the publication of the experiments
till Fräulein v. Chauvin had repeated them in larger
numbers, but as my Axolotls have not bred this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">565</a></span>
year (1875) I must abandon my scheme, and this
can be done the more readily because, for the
theoretical consideration of the facts, it is immaterial
whether <i>all</i> or only <i>nearly all</i> the Axolotls
could have been compelled to undergo transformation.
I must not, however, omit to mention that
Herr Gehrig, the curator of our Zoological
Museum, bred a considerable number of larvæ
from the same brood as that with which Fräulein
v. Chauvin experimented, and that of these larvæ
six lived over the winter <i>without undergoing metamorphosis</i>.
They were always kept in deep water
and thus furnished the converse experiment to
those recorded above; they further prove that this
whole brood did not have a previous tendency to
undergo metamorphosis.</p>

<p>If these new facts are to be made use of to
explain the nature of this extraordinary process of
transformation in accordance with our present
conception, the data already known must in the
first place be called to our aid.</p>

<p>It has first to be established that <i>Siredon
Mexicanus</i> never, as far as we know, undergoes
metamorphosis in its native country. This Amphibian
is there only known in the <i>Siredon</i> form, a
statement which I have taken from De <span class="locked">Saussure,<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a></span>
who has himself observed the Axolotl in the Mexican
lakes. This naturalist never found a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">566</a></span>
Amblystoma in the neighbourhood of the lakes,
“nevertheless the larva (Axolotl) is so common
there that it is brought into the market by thousands.”
De Saussure believes that in Mexico the
Axolotl does not undergo <span class="locked">transformation.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a></span> The
same statement is distinctly made by <span class="locked">Cope,<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a></span> whose
specimens of <i>Siredon Mexicanus</i> bred in America,
even in captivity showed “no tendency to become
metamorphosed.” On the other hand Tegetmeier
<span class="locked">observed<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a></span> that one out of five specimens obtained
from the Lake of Mexico underwent metamorphosis,
and this accordingly establishes the second fact,
viz. that the true Axolotl becomes transformed
under certain conditions into an Amblystoma when
in captivity.</p>

<p>This last remark would be superfluous if, as was
for a long time believed, the Paris Axolotls, of
which the metamorphosis was first observed and
which at the time made such a sensation, were
actually <i>Siredon Mexicanus</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the <i>Siredon</i> which
alone in its native country bears the name of
Axolotl. In his first communication Duméril was
himself of this opinion; he then termed the animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">567</a></span>
“<i>Siredon Mexicanus vel Humboldtii</i>,”<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> but subsequently,
in his amplified <span class="locked">work<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a></span> on the transformation
of the Axolotl observed in the Jardin
des Plantes, he retracted this view, and after a
critical comparison of the five described species
of <i>Siredon</i>, he came to the conclusion that the
species in the possession of the Paris Museum was
probably <i>Siredon Lichenoides</i> (Baird). All the
transformations of Axolotls observed in Europe
must consequently be referred to this species,
since they were&mdash;at least as far as I know&mdash;all
derived from the Paris colony. My own experimental
specimens were also indirectly descended
from these.</p>

<p>Now it must be admitted that this does not
coincide with the fact that the Amblystoma form
which Duméril first obtained from his Axolotls
agreed with Cope’s species, <i>A. Tigrinum</i>, while on
the other hand we learn from <span class="locked">Marsh<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a></span> that <i>Siredon
Lichenoides</i> (Baird), when it does undergo metamorphosis,
becomes transformed into <i>Amblystoma
Mavortium</i> (Baird).</p>

<p>Marsh found <i>Siredon Lichenoides</i> in mountain
lakes (7000 feet above the sea) in the southwest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">568</a></span>
of the United States (Wyoming Territory),
and obtained from them, by breeding in aquaria,
<i>Amblystoma Mavortium</i> (Baird). He considers
it indeed doubtful whether the Amphibian undergoes
this transformation in its native habitat,
although he certainly states this opinion without
rigorous proof on purely theoretical considerations,
because, according to his view, “the low temperature
is there less <span class="locked">favourable.”<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a></span></p>

<p>If I throw doubt upon this last statement it is
simply because <i>Amblystoma Mavortium</i> is found
native in many parts of the United States, viz:&mdash;in
California, New Mexico, Texas, Kansas,
Nebraska, and Minnesota. It is indeed by no
means inconceivable that in the mountain lakes
where Marsh obtained this species, it may behave
differently with respect to metamorphosis than in
other habitats, and this appears probable from
certain observations upon <i>Triton</i> which will be
subsequently referred to.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the absence of further observations,
we must admit that the Paris Axolotls were
not <i>Siredon Lichenoides</i>, but some nearly allied and
probably new species. But little information is
furnished by observing the course of the transformation,
although it is at least established that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">569</a></span>
Axolotl in its native habitat does not undergo
metamorphosis or does so as exceptionally as in
Europe. Unfortunately in his papers Duméril
gives no precise statement respecting the locality
of this species imported from “Mexico”&mdash;it is
probable that he was himself unacquainted with
it, so that I can only state on the authority of
Cope that Amblystoma has never been brought
from south of the provinces of Tamaulipas
and Chilhuahua, <i>i.e.</i> south of the Tropic of
<span class="locked">Cancer.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a></span></p>

<p>This last statement, however, gives no certainty
to the matter. Of much more importance is the
above-mentioned fact, that the true Axolotl of the
lakes about the city of Mexico does not, as a rule,
become transformed into an Amblystoma in that
locality, although this species in certain cases
undergoes metamorphosis when in confinement.
From this circumstance and from the fact that the
Paris Axolotl likewise experienced but a very small
percentage of metamorphosis in captivity, we may
venture to conclude that this species also, in its
native habitat, either does not become transformed
at all or does so only exceptionally.</p>

<p>But there is yet another body of facts which
come prominently into view on considering the
history of the transformations. I refer to the
existence of numerous species of <i>Amblystoma</i> in a
natural state. In the “Revision of the genera of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">570</a></span>
<i>Salamandridæ</i>,” published some years ago by
<span class="locked">Strauch,<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a></span> this author, following <span class="locked">Cope,<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a></span> gives
twenty species of <i>Amblystoma</i> as inhabiting North
America. Although some of these species are
based on single examples, and consequently, as
Strauch justly remarks, “may well have to be
reduced in the course of time,” there must nevertheless
always remain a large number of species
which live and propagate as true Amblystomas,
and of which the habitat extends from the latitude
of New York to that of New Mexico. There are
therefore true species of <i>Siredon</i> which regularly
assume the Amblystoma form under their natural
conditions of life, and which propagate in this
form, while, on the other hand, there are at least
two species which, under their existing natural conditions
of life, always propagate as <i>Siredon</i>. It is
but another mode of expression for the same facts
if we say that the Mexican Axolotl and the Paris
<i>Siredon</i>&mdash;whether this is <i>Lichenoides</i> or some other
species&mdash;stand at a lower grade of phyletic
development than those species of <i>Amblystoma</i>
which propagate in the salamander form. No one
can raise any objection to this statement, while the
alternative view maintained by all authors contains
a theory either expressed or implied which is, as I
believe, incorrect, viz. that the Mexican Axolotl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">571</a></span>
<i>has remained</i> at an inferior stage of phyletic
development.</p>

<p>All <span class="locked">zoologists<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a></span> who have expressed an opinion
upon the transformation of the Axolotl, and
who are not, like the first observer of this fact,
embarrassed by Cuvier’s views as to the immutability
of species, regard the phenomenon as though
a species, which owing to some special conditions
had hitherto remained at a low stage of development,
had now through some other influences been
compelled to advance to a higher stage.</p>

<p>I believed for a long time that the phenomenon
could not otherwise be comprehended, so little was
I then in a position to bring all the facts into harmony
with this view. Thus in the year 1872 I
expressed myself as <span class="locked">follows<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></span>:&mdash;“Why should not
a sudden change in all the conditions of life (transference
from Mexico to Paris) have a direct action
on the organization of the Axolotl, causing it suddenly
to reach a higher stage of development, such
as many of its allies have already attained, and
which obviously lies in the nature of its organization&mdash;a
stage which it would perhaps itself have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">572</a></span>
reached, although later, in its native country? Or
is it inconceivable that the sudden removal from
8000 feet above the sea (Mexican plateau) to the
altitude of Paris, may have given the respiratory
organs an impetus in the direction of the transformation
imminent? In all probability we have here
to do with the direct action of changed conditions
of life.”</p>

<p>That the substance of this last statement must
still hold good is obvious from the experiments previously
described, which show that by the application
of definite external influences, we have it to a
certain extent in our power to produce the transformation.
It is precisely in this last point that
there lies the new feature furnished by these experiments.</p>

<p>But are we also compelled to interpret the phenomenon
in the above manner? <i>i.e.</i> as a sudden
advance in the phyletic development of the species
occurring, so to speak, at one stroke? I believe
not.</p>

<p>What first made this view appear to me erroneous,
was the appearance of the living Amblystomas
bred from my Axolotl larvæ. These creatures
by no means differed from the Axolotls merely in
single characters, but they were distinct from
the latter in their entire aspect; they differed in
some measure in all their parts, in some but
slightly and in other parts strongly&mdash;in brief, they
had become quite different animals. In accordance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">573</a></span>
with this, their mode of life had become completely
modified; they no longer lived in the water,
but remained concealed by day among the damp
moss of the vivarium, coming forth only by night
in search of food in dry places.</p>

<p>I had been able to perceive the great difference
between the two stages of development from the
anatomical data with which I had long been
familiar, and which Duméril had made known with
respect to the structure of his Amblystomas. But
the collecting of numerous details gives no very
vivid picture of the metamorphosis; it was the
appearance of the living animal that first made me
conscious how deep-seated was the transformation
which we have here before us, and that this change
not merely affected those parts which would be
directly influenced by the change in the conditions
of life, such as the gills, but that most if not all
the parts of the animal underwent a transformation,
which could in part be well explained as morphological
adaptation to new conditions of life, and
partly as a consequence of this adaptation (correlative
changes), but could not possibly be regarded
as the sudden action of these changed
conditions.</p>

<p>Such at least is my view of the case, according
to which a <i>per saltum</i> development of the species
of such a kind as must here have taken place, is
quite inconceivable.</p>

<p>I may venture to assume that most observers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">574</a></span>
of the metamorphosis of Axolotl have, like myself,
not been hitherto aware of the extent of the
transformation, and it may thus be explained why
the theoretical bearings of the case have on all
sides been incorrectly conceived. We have here
obviously a quite extraordinary case of the first
order of importance. I believe that it can easily
be shown that the explanation of the history of the
metamorphosis of the Paris Axolotl which has
hitherto been pretty generally accepted, necessarily
comprises a very far-reaching principle. If this
interpretation is correct, then in my opinion must
also hold good the ideas of those who, like Kölliker,
Askenasy, Nägeli, and, among the philosophers,
Hartmann and Hübner, would refer the transformation
of species in the first instance to a power
innate in the organism, to an active, <i>i.e.</i> a self-urging
“law of development”&mdash;a phyletic vital
force.</p>

<p>Thus, if the Axolotls transformed into Amblystomas
are regarded as individuals which, impelled
by external influences, have anticipated the phyletic
development of the others, then this advance can
only be ascribed to a phyletic vital force, since the
transformation is sudden, and leaves no time for
gradual adaptation in the course of generations.
The <i>indirect</i> influence of the external conditions
of life, <i>i.e.</i> natural selection, is thus excluded from
the beginning. But the <i>direct</i> action of the
changed conditions of life by no means furnishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">575</a></span>
an explanation of the complete transformation of
the whole structure, such as I have already alluded
to, and which I will now enter into more closely.</p>

<p>The differences between the Paris Axolotl and
its Amblystoma according to Duméril, Kölliker,
and my own observations are as <span class="locked">follow:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. The gills disappear; the gill-clefts close up,
and of the branchial arches only the foremost remain,
the posterior ones disappearing. At the
same time the os <i>hyoideum</i> becomes changed
(Duméril).</p>

<p>2. The dorsal crest completely disappears
(Duméril).</p>

<p>3. The aquatic tail becomes transformed into
one like that of the salamanders (Duméril), which,
however, is not as in the salamander cylindrical,
but somewhat compressed laterally (Weismann).</p>

<p>4. The skin becomes yellowish white, irregularly
spotted on the sides and back (Duméril),
whilst at the same time its former grey-black
ground-colour changes into a shining greenish
black (Weismann); it loses, moreover, the slimy
secretion of the skin, and the cutaneous glands
become insignificant (Kölliker).</p>

<p>5. The eyes become prominent and the pupils
narrow (Kölliker), and eyelids capable of completely
covering the eyes are formed; in Axolotl
only a narrow annular fold surrounds the eyes, so
that these cannot be closed (Weismann).</p>

<p>6. The toes become narrowed and lose their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">576</a></span>
skin-like appendages (Kölliker), or more precisely,
the half webs which connect the proximal extremities
of the toes on all the feet (Weismann).</p>

<p>7. The teeth are disposed in this species, as in
all other <i>Amblystomæ</i>, in transverse series; whilst
in Axolotl, as in <i>Triton</i> larvæ, they are arranged
at the sides of the jaw in the form of a curved
arch-like band beset with several rows of <span class="locked">teeth.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a></span>
(Duméril. See his fig., <i>loc. cit.</i> p. 279).</p>

<p>8. In Axolotl the lower jaw, in addition to the
teeth on the upper edge of the bone, also bears
“de très petites dents disposées sur plusieurs
rangs;” these last disappear after metamorphosis
(Duméril). I will add that the persistent teeth
belong to the <i>os dentale</i> of the lower jaw, and
those that are shed to the <i>os operculare</i>.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a></p>

<p>9. The surface of the posterior moveable part
of the body is slightly concave both before and
after transformation; the anterior part is, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">577</a></span>
less concave in <i>Amblystoma</i> than in <i>Siredon</i>
(Duméril).</p>

<p>I have not yet been able to verify Duméril’s 7th
and 9th statements, as I did not want to kill any
of my living <span class="locked">Amblystomas,<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a></span> simply in order to
confirm the observations of a naturalist in whom
one may certainly place complete confidence.
Neither have I as yet observed the transformation
of the branchial arches, but all the other statements
of Kölliker and Duméril I can entirely corroborate.</p>

<p>The structural differences between Axolotl and
Amblystoma are considerably greater and of more
importance than those between allied genera, or
indeed than between the families of the Urodela.
The genus <i>Siredon</i> undoubtedly belongs to a
different sub-order to the genus <i>Amblystoma</i> into
which it occasionally becomes transformed.
Strauch, the most recent systematic worker at
this group, distinguishes the sub-order <i>Salamandrida</i>
from that of the <i>Ichthyodea</i> by the possession
of eyelids, and by the situation of the palatine
teeth in single rows on the posterior edge of
the palatal bone: in <i>Ichthyodea</i> the eyelids are
wanting and the palatine teeth are either “situated
on the anterior edge of the palatal bone,” or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">578</a></span>
“cover the whole surface of the palatal plates in
brush-like tufts.”</p>

<p>How is it possible to regard such widely divergent
anatomical characters as changes suddenly
produced by the action (but once exerted) of deviating
conditions of life? Hand in hand with the
shedding of the old and the appearance of new
palatine teeth, there occurs a change in the anatomical
structure of the vertebral column, and also&mdash;as
we may fairly conclude from Kölliker’s
correct observation of the cessation of the slimy
secretion&mdash;in the histological structure of the skin.
Who would undertake to explain all these profound
modifications as the direct and sudden
action of certain external influences? And if any
one were inclined to explain such changes as a
consequence of the disappearance of the gills, <i>i.e.</i>
as correlative changes, what else is such a correlation
than the phyletic vital force under another
name?</p>

<p>If from one change arising from the direct
action of external agencies, the whole body can in
two days become transformed in all its parts, in
the precise manner which appears best adapted for
the new conditions of life under which it is henceforward
to exist, then the word “correlation” is
only a phrase which explains nothing, but which
prevents any attempt at a better explanation, and
it would be preferable to profess simply the belief
in a phyletic vital force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">579</a></span></p>

<p>Moreover, it is hardly permissible to seek such
an explanation, since Urodela are known which
have no gills in the adult state, and which nevertheless
possess all the other characters of the <i>Ichthyodea</i>,
viz. want of eyelids, characteristic palatine
teeth, and the tongue bone. This is the case
with the genera <i>Amphiuma</i> (Linn.), <i>Menopoma</i>
(Harl.), and <i>Cryptobranchus</i> (v. d. Hoev.). The two
first genera, as is known, still possess gill-clefts,
but <i>Cryptobranchus</i> has even lost these clefts,
which, as in <i>Amblystoma</i>, are overgrown by skin;
nevertheless <i>Cryptobranchus</i> is, according to the
concurrent testimony of all systematists, a true
salamander in habits, tongue bone, palatine
<span class="locked">teeth,<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a></span> &amp;c. It must further be added that the
Axolotl itself can lose the gills without thereby
becoming transformed into an Amblystoma. I
have previously mentioned that in Axolotls which
were kept in shallow water the gills frequently
became diminutive, and it also sometimes happens
that they completely shrivel up. I possess an
Axolotl preserved in alcohol in which the gills have
shrivelled up into small irregular bunches, and the
dorsal crest is also so completely absent that its
place is occupied by a long furrow, and even on the
tail the crest has entirely disappeared from the
lower edge and about half from the upper edge.
Notwithstanding this, the creature is widely removed
from Amblystoma in structure; it possesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">580</a></span>
the arched branchial apparatus, the palatine teeth,
the skin, &amp;c., of the Axolotl.</p>

<p>These facts prove, therefore, that the shedding
of the gills by no means always entails all the
other modifications which we observe in the metamorphosis
of Axolotl, so that these modifications
are thus not by any means the necessary and
immediate consequence of such gill shedding.</p>

<p>Whether these modifications will occur after a
long series of generations&mdash;whether the successors
of <i>Cryptobranchus</i> will also one day acquire the
salamandriform structure is another question, and
one which I could not exactly answer in the
negative. But this question does not here come
into consideration, as we are now only concerned
with the <i>immediate result</i> of the shedding of the
gills.</p>

<p>The problem appears therefore to be as follows:&mdash;Either
the hitherto received interpretation
of the transformational history of the Axolotl as a
further development of the species is incorrect, or
else the case of Axolotl incontestably proves the
existence of a phyletic vital force.</p>

<p>We have now to ask whether the facts of this
transformational history are not capable of another
explanation.</p>

<p>I believe that this is certainly possible, and that
another interpretation can be shown to be correct
with some degree of probability.</p>

<p>I am of opinion that those Amblystomas which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">581</a></span>
have been developed in captivity in certain instances
from <i>Siredon Mexicanus</i> (<i>S. Pisciformis</i>),
as well as from the Paris Axolotls, are not progressive,
but reversion forms; I believe that the
Axolotls which now inhabit the Mexican lakes
were Amblystomas at a former geological (or
better, zoological) epoch, but that owing to
changes in their conditions of life, they have
reverted to the earlier perennibranchiate stage.</p>

<p>I was undoubtedly first led to this conception
by the results which arose from my studies on the
seasonal dimorphism of <span class="locked">butterflies.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a></span> In this case
we were also concerned with the two different
forms under which one and the same species
appears, and of which it was shown to be probable
that the one is phyletically older than the other.
The younger summer form, according to my view,
has arisen, through the gradual amelioration of the
climate, from the winter form, which at an earlier
zoological epoch was the only one in existence;
but the latter, the primary form, has not for this
reason ceased to exist, but now alternates in each
year as a winter form with the secondary summer
form.</p>

<p>Now with seasonally dimorphic butterflies, it
was easily possible to induce the summer brood to
assume the winter form by exposing their pupæ
for a long time to a low temperature; and it was
shown to be highly probable that this abrupt and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">582</a></span>
often very extensive change or transformation,
only apparently takes place suddenly, and is but
the apparent result of the action of cold upon this
generation, whilst in fact it depends upon reversion
to the primary form of the species, so that the
low temperature, which is only once applied, gives
but the impetus to reversion, and is not the true
cause of the transformation. This cause must
rather be sought in the long continued action of
the cold to which the ancestors of our existing
butterflies were subjected for thousands of generations,
and of which the final result is the winter
form.</p>

<p>If we assume for an instant that my interpretation
of the transformation of Axolotl as just offered
is correct, we should have conditions in many
respects analagous to those of seasonal dimorphism.
It is true that in this case the two forms
no longer alternate regularly with each other, but
the primary form may occasionally appear instead
of the secondary form, owing to the action of
external conditions.</p>

<p>Just as in the case of seasonal dimorphism it
is possible to compel the summer generation to
abandon the summer form, and to assume the
winter guise by the action of cold; so in the
present case we are able to induce the Axolotl to
adopt the Amblystoma form by making aërial
respiration compulsory at a certain stage of life;
and further, just as in seasonal dimorphism it can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">583</a></span>
be shown that this artificially produced change is
only apparently an abrupt transformation, and is
actually a reversion to the much older winter
form; so here we have not an actual, but only an
apparent remodelling of the species&mdash;a reversion
to the phyletically older form.</p>

<p>This certainly appears a paradox, inasmuch as
a form here arises by reversion which must yet
undoubtedly rank as the more highly developed.
I believe, however, that much which seems paradoxical
in this statement will disappear on further
examination.</p>

<p>It must in the first place be taken into consideration
that the phyletic development of species
need not by any means always take place by
advancement. We have indeed many cases of
retrogressive development, although in a somewhat
different sense, as with parasites and those
forms which have degenerated from free locomotion
to a sedentary mode of <span class="locked">life.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a></span> I do not
confuse this kind of retrogressive development,
arising from the arrest of certain organs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">584</a></span>
systems of organs, with true reversion. The
latter is a return to a form which has already been
once in existence; but in the former case, in spite
of all simplification of the organization, some
entirely new feature always comes into existence.
But I am not able to see any absurdity in the
assumption that even true reversion, whether of a
whole species or of the individuals of a certain
district, may be regarded as possible, and I require
no further concession. Why, for example, should
it be inconceivable that at a very remote period
the Axolotl was adapted to a life on land; that
through the direct and indirect action of changed
conditions of life it gradually acquired the salamander
form, but that subsequently, through new
and unfavourable changes in the conditions of
life, it again relapsed to the older form, or at least
to one nearly related thereto?</p>

<p>At any rate such an assumption contains
nothing opposed to known facts, but can be supported
in many ways, and finally it commends
itself, at least in my opinion, as offering the only
admissible explanation of the facts before us.</p>

<p>The existence of a whole series of species of
<i>Amblystoma</i>, as already mentioned, at once shows
that species of <i>Siredon</i> can become elevated into
the salamander form, and can propagate regularly
in this state, and further, that this phyletic advance
has already actually taken place in many
species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">585</a></span></p>

<p>That degeneration may also occur from this
high stage to a lower stage of development, is
shown by many observations on our water-salamanders.
It is known that under certain circumstances
Tritons, as it is generally expressed, become
“sexually mature in the larval condition.”</p>

<p>In the year 1864 De <span class="locked">Filippi<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a></span> found fifty Tritons
in a pool at Andermatten, in the neighbourhood of
Puneigen, and of these only two showed the
structure of the adult water-salamander; all the
others still possessed gills, but notwithstanding this,
they agreed in both sexes, in size and in the development
of the sexual organs, with mature animals.
De Filippi established that these “sexually mature
larvæ” not only resembled larvæ externally through
the possession of gills, but that they also possessed
all the other anatomical characters of the
larvæ, <i>i.e.</i> the characteristic bunches of palatine
teeth situated on both sides in the position of the
subsequent single rows, and a vertebral column
represented throughout its whole length by the
<i>chorda dorsalis</i>.</p>

<p>According to my view this would be a case of
the reversion of the Triton to the immediately anterior
phyletic stage, <i>i.e.</i> to the perennibranchiate
stage, and in the present instance the majority of
zoologists who take their stand by the theory of
descent, would certainly concur in this view. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">586</a></span>
should at least consider it to be a useless play
upon words did we here speak of larval reproduction,
and thereby believe that we had explained
something. The animal certainly becomes sexually
mature in the same condition as that in which it first
appears as a larva, but we first get an insight into
the nature of this process by considering that this
so-called “sexually mature larva” has the precise
structure which must have been possessed by the
preceding phyletic stage of the species, and that
an individual reversion to the older phyletic stage
of the species is consequently before us. I maintain
that Duméril is in error in regarding this case
of the Triton as parallel with the true larval reproduction
of Wagner’s <i>Cecidomyia</i> larva. In
this last case it is certainly not reversion to an
older phyletic stage that confers the power of
reproduction upon the larvæ, since the latter do
not represent an older phyletic stage of the
species, but must have arisen contemporaneously
with this last stage. The enormous structural
difference between the larvæ and the imagines is
not explained by the latter having arisen from the
former supplementarily as a finished production,
but by both having been contemporaneously
adapted to continually diverging conditions of
<span class="locked">life.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a></span> Considered phyletically, these larvæ are by
no means necessarily transitional to the origination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">587</a></span>
of the flies. They could have been quite different
without the form of the imagines having been
thereby modified, since the stages of insect metamorphosis
vary independently of each other in
accordance with the conditions of life to which
they are subjected, and exert scarcely any, or only
a very small form-determining influence upon each
other, as has been amply proved in the preceding
essay. In any case the power of these larvæ (the
<i>Cecidomyiæ</i>) to propagate themselves asexually
was first acquired as a secondary character, as
appears from the fact that there exist numerous
species of the same genus which do not “nurse.”
In the form which they now possess they could
never have played the part of the final stage of
the ontogeny, nor could they formerly have possessed
the power of sexual <span class="locked">reproduction.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a></span> In
brief, we are here concerned with true larval reproduction,
whilst in Triton we have reversion to
an older phyletic <span class="locked">stage.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">588</a></span></p>

<p>I cannot agree with my friend Professor Haeckel
when he occasionally designates the reversion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">589</a></span>
the Tritons as an “adaptation” to a purely aqueous
<span class="locked">existence.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a></span> We could here only speak of “adaptation”
if we took the word in a quite different sense
to that in which it was first introduced into
science by Darwin and Wallace. These naturalists
thereby designate a gradual bodily transformation
appearing in the course of generations in correspondence
with the new requirements of altered
conditions of life or, in other words, the action of
natural selection, and not the result of a suddenly
and direct acting transforming cause exerted but
once on a generation.</p>

<p>Just because the word “adaptation” can be
used in ordinary language in many senses, it is
desirable that it should have only <i>one</i> precise signification,
and above all that we should not speak
of adaptation where scarcely any morphological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">590</a></span>
change occurs, but only a kind of functional
change in the sense used by <span class="locked">Dohrn.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a></span> This is the
case for example, when <span class="locked">Forel<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a></span> shows that fresh
water Pulmonifera, the organization of which is
attributed to the direct respiration of air, can
nevertheless become settled in the greatest depths
of mountain lakes through their lungs being again
employed as gills. That not the least change in
the lungs hereby takes place is shown by the
observations of Von <span class="locked">Siebold,<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a></span> who saw the shallow
water Pulmonifera using their lungs alternately
for direct aërial and aquatic respiration, according
to the amount of air contained in the water. If
with Von Siebold we merely apply the word
“adaptation” to such cases, this expression would
lose the special sense which it originally conveyed,
and the word would have to be abandoned as a
<i>terminus technicus</i>; still, such cases may perhaps
be spoken of as <i>physiological</i> adaptation.</p>

<p>In any case the reproductive “larvæ” of the
Tritons as little present a case of true adaptation
as the Axolotl, which occasionally becomes transformed
into an Amblystoma. In both cases the
transformation referred to is by no means indispensable
to the life of the individual. Mature Tritons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">591</a></span>
(devoid of gills) can exist, as I have myself seen, for
many months, and probably also for a year in deep
water, although adapted for purely pulmonary
respiration; whilst Axolotls, as I have already mentioned,
can live well for a year in shallow water
poor in air. If their gills by this means become
shrivelled up or completely disappear, even this is
not adaptation in the Darwinian sense, but the
effect of directly acting external influences, and
chiefly of diminished use.</p>

<p>A case entirely analagous to that of Filippi’s
was observed by Jullien in 1869. Four female larvæ
of <i>Lissotriton Punctatus</i> (Bell)&mdash;(synonymous
with <i>Triton Tæniatus</i>, Schnd.), taken from a pool,
proved to be sexually mature. They contained
mature eggs in their ovaria ready for laying, and
two of them actually deposited eggs. Four male
larvæ found in the same pool, appeared to be
equally developed with respect to size, but their
testicles contained no free spermatozoa, but only
<span class="locked">sperm-cells.<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a></span></p>

<p>I have met with a third case of a similar kind
mentioned by Leydig in his memoir, rich in interesting
details, “on the tailed Amphibians of
the Wurtemburg <span class="locked">fauna.”<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a></span> Schreibers, the former
director of the Vienna Museum, also found
“larvæ” of Tritons with well-developed gills, but
of the size of the “adult male individuals,” and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">592</a></span>
as shown by anatomical investigation, with well
“developed sexual organs,” the ovaria especially
being distended with eggs.</p>

<p>It is thus established that species which long
ago reached the salamander stage in phyletic
development, may occasionally degenerate to the
perennibranchiate stage. This fact obviously
makes my conception of the Axolotl as a reversion
form appear much less paradoxical&mdash;indeed, the
cases of reversion in Triton are precisely analagous
to the process which I suppose to have taken
place in the Axolotl. We have only to substitute
Amblystomas for Tritons, to imagine the pool in
which De Filippi found his “sexually mature Triton
larvæ” enlarged to the size of the Lake of Mexico,
and to conceive the unknown, and perhaps here
transitory, causes of the reversion to be permanent,
and we have all that is necessary, so far as
we at present know, for the restoration of the
Axolotl; we obtain a perennibranchiate population
of the lake.</p>

<p>It has not yet been determined whether the
perennibranchiate form of the Triton actually prevailed
permanently in De Filippi’s pool, since, so
far as I know, this has not since been examined.</p>

<p>Let us, however, assume for an instant that this
is really the case, and that there exists at that
spot a colony of sexually reproductive perennibranchiate
Tritons: should we wonder if a true
Triton occasionally appeared among their progeny,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">593</a></span>
or if we were able to induce the majority of the
individuals of this brood to become metamorphosed
into Tritons by keeping them in shallow water?
According to my view this is precisely the case of
the Mexican Axolotl.</p>

<p>I need not, however, restrict myself to this in
order to support my hypothesis, but must also
directly combat the view hitherto received, since
the latter is in contradiction with facts.</p>

<p>Did there really exist in the Axolotl a tendency
to sudden phyletic advancement, then one fact
would remain quite incomprehensible, viz. the
sterility of the Amblystomas.</p>

<p>Out of about thirty Amblystomas obtained by
Duméril down to the year 1870, there was not one
in a state of sexual maturity; neither copulation
nor deposition of eggs took place, and the anatomical
investigation of single specimens showed that
the eggs were immature, and that the spermatozoa,
although present, were without the undulating membrane
characteristic of the salamanders, but were
not devoid of all power of movement, only, as established
by Quatrefages, were “incompletely <span class="locked">motile.”<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a></span></p>

<p>So also the five Amblystomas about which I
have been writing, show up to the present time no
appearance of reproduction.</p>

<p>The objection raised by <span class="locked">Sacc,<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a></span> that the sterility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">594</a></span>
of the Amblystomas bred from Axolotls is attributable
to “bad nourishment,” is obviously of
but little avail. How is it that the Axolotls, which
are fed in a precisely similar manner, propagate so
readily? Moreover, I am able to expressly assert
that my Amblystomas were very well fed. It is
true that they have as yet scarcely reached the
age of two years, but the Axolotl propagates
freely in the second year, and some of Duméril’s
Amblystomas were five years old in 1870.</p>

<p>This fact of the sterility is strongly opposed to
the idea that these Amblystomas are the regular
precursors of the phyletically advancing genus
<i>Siredon</i>.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> I will by no means assert that my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">595</a></span>
theory of reversion actually explains the sterility,
but it is at least not directly opposed to it. Mere
reversion forms may die off without propagating
themselves; but a <i>new form</i> called forth by the
action of a phyletic vital force should not be sterile,
because this is the precise “aim” which the vital
force had in view. The conception of a vital force
comprises that of teleology.</p>

<p>The sterility of Amblystoma moreover, although
not completely explicable from our standpoint, can
be shown to be a phenomenon not entirely isolated.
In the above mentioned case of <i>Lissotriton Punctatus</i>,
the female “larvæ” were certainly sexually
mature and laid eggs, but the males of the same
period contained in their testicles no fully developed
spermatozoa.</p>

<p>Other cases of this kind are unknown to me;
at the time when I made the experiments with
butterflies already recorded (see the first essay),
this point of view was remote, and I therefore
neglected to examine the artificially bred reversion
forms with respect to their organs of reproduction.
But general considerations lead to the supposition
that atavistic forms may easily remain sterile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">596</a></span></p>

<p>Darwin<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> finds the proximate causes of sterility
in the first place in the action of widely diverging
conditions of life, and in the next place in the
crossing of individuals widely different in constitution.
Now it is certainly deviating conditions of
life which lead to the metamorphosis of the Axolotl,
and from this point of view it cannot be surprising
if we find those individuals sterile which show
themselves so especially affected by these changed
conditions as to revert to the salamander form.</p>

<p>By this it is not in any way meant to be asserted
that reversion is invariably accompanied by sterility,
and one cannot raise as an objection to my interpretation
of the metamorphosis of the Axolotl, that
a reproductive colony of Axolotls could never have
arisen by reversion. On the contrary, Jullien’s
egg-depositing female Triton larvæ show that also
with reversion the power of reproduction may be
completely <span class="locked">preserved.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a></span> From the above-mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">597</a></span>
general causes of sterility, it may even be inferred
that fertility can be lost in different degrees, and it
can be further understood to a certain extent why
this fertility is more completely lost by reversion
to the Amblystoma, than by the reversion of the
Triton to the perennibranchiate form.</p>

<p>If in these cases the reversion is brought about
by a change in the conditions of life, we may
perhaps suppose that the magnitude of this change
would determine the degree of fertility, and the
preservation of the reversion form. Still more,
however, would the fertility be influenced by the
extent of the morphological difference resulting
from the reversion. We know that the blending
of very different constitutions (<i>e.g.</i> the crossing of
different species) produces sterility. Something
similar results from the sudden reversion to a stage
of development widely different in its whole
structure. Here also we have in a certain sense
the union of two very different constitutions in one
individual&mdash;a kind of crossing.</p>

<p>From this point of view it can in some measure
be comprehended why sterility may be a result of
reversion; on the other hand, we thereby obtain no
explanation why, with the same amount of morphological
difference, in one case complete sterility, and
in another relative fertility occurs. The morphological
difference between Axolotl and Amblystoma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">598</a></span>
is exactly the same as between Triton and its
“sexually mature larva;” the difference between
the two cases of reversion depends entirely upon
the direction of the leap, that taken in the former
case being precisely opposite in direction to that
taken in the latter.</p>

<p>Herein might be sought the explanation of the
different strength with which the reproductive
power is affected; not indeed in the direction of
the leap itself, but in the differences in the ontogeny
which are determined by the differences in the
direction of the leap. The reversion of the
Triton to an older phyletic stage coincides with
the arrest at a younger ontogenetic stage; or, in
other words, the older stage of the phylogeny to
which reversion takes place is still entirely
comprised in the ontogeny of each individual.
Each Triton is perennibranchiate throughout a
long period of its life; the reverting individual
simply reverts to the older phyletic stage by
remaining at the larval stage of its individual
development.</p>

<p>But it is quite different with the reversion of the
Axolotl to the formerly acquired, but long since
abandoned Amblystoma form. This is not retained
in the ontogeny of Axolotl, but has been completely
lost; for a long series of generations&mdash;so
must we suppose&mdash;the ontogeny has always only
attained to the perennibranchiate form. Now if at
the present time certain individuals were compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">599</a></span>
to revert to the Amblystoma form, certainly no
greater leap would have been made from a morphological
point of view, than in the reversion of
Triton to the perennibranchiate form, but at the
same time the leap would be in another direction,
viz. over a long series of generations back to a form
which the species had not produced for a long period,
and which had to a certain extent become foreign
to it. We should thus have here also the grafting
of a widely different constitution upon that of the
Axolotl, or, if one prefers it, the commingling of
two widely different constitutions.</p>

<p>Of course I am far from wishing to pretend that
this “explanation” is exact; it is nothing more
than an attempt to point out the direction in which
the causes affecting the reproductive powers in
different degrees are to be looked for. A deeper
penetration into and special demonstration of the
manner in which these causes bring about such
results, must be reserved for a future period. For
the present it must suffice to have indicated that
there is an essential distinction between the two
kinds of reversion, and to have made it to some
extent comprehensible that this distinction may be
the determining impulse with respect to the question
of sterility. Perhaps the law here concealed from
us may one day be thus formulated:&mdash;Atavistic
individuals lose the power of reproduction the more
completely, the greater the number of generations
of their ancestors whose ontogeny no longer comprises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">600</a></span>
the phyletically older stage to which the
reversion takes place.</p>

<p>The hypothesis which interprets the transformation
of the Axolotl as a case of reversion, thus holds
out the possibility of our being able to comprehend
the sterility of the Amblystomas arising in this
manner, whilst, on the other hand, for the adherents
of a phyletic vital force, not only is this observed
sterility as Duméril expresses it “un véritable
énigme scientifique,” but an absolute paradox.
We should expect such a directive and inciting
principle to call into existence new forms having
vitality and not destined to perish, the more so
when it is concerned with a combination of
structural characters which, when originating in
another manner (viz. from other species of <i>Siredon</i>),
have long since shown themselves to have vitality
and reproductive power. We are indeed acquainted
with species of <i>Amblystoma</i> which propagate as
such, and each of which arises from an Axolotl-like
larva. Thus we cannot regard the sterile Amblystomas
produced by the Paris Axolotls as abortive
attempts of a vital force&mdash;an interpretation which
is certainly in itself already sufficiently rash.</p>

<p>Now if it be asked what change in the conditions
of life could have led to the reversion in the Lake
of <span class="locked">Mexico<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a></span> of the Amblystoma to the Siredon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">601</a></span>
form, I must admit that I can only offer a conjectural
reply, having but a conditional value so
long as it is not supported by a precise knowledge
of the conditions there obtaining, and of the habits
both of the Axolotl and of the Amblystoma.</p>

<p>It may be supposed generally that reversion is
brought about by the same external conditions as
those which formerly produced the perennibranchiate
stage. This supposition is in the first place
supported by the experiments here recorded, since
it is evidently the inducement to aërial respiration
which causes the young Axolotl to revert to the
Amblystoma form, <i>i.e.</i> the inciting cause under
whose domineering influence the Amblystoma form
must have arisen.</p>

<p>Here again the case is quite similar to that of
seasonally dimorphic butterflies. Reversion of
the summer brood to the winter form is there most
easily caused by the action of cold, <i>i.e.</i> by the
same influence as that under whose sway the winter
form was developed.</p>

<p>We know indeed that reversion may also arise
by the crossing of races and species, and I have
attempted to show that reversion in butterflies may
also be brought about by other influences than
cold; but still the most probable supposition
obviously is, that reversion would be caused by the
persistent action of the same influences as those
which in a certain sense created the perennibranchiate
form. That the latter was produced under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">602</a></span>
the influence of an aquatic life there can be no
doubt, and thus, in accordance with my supposition,
the hypothetical <i>Amblystoma Mexicanum</i>, the
supposed ancestral form of the Axolotl of the
Mexican Lake, might have been caused to revert to
the perennibranchiate form by a reduction in the
possibilities of its living upon land, and by its being
compelled to frequent the water.</p>

<p>I will not here return to the consideration of
every other opinion <i>ab initio</i>. It is very advisable
to distinguish between the mere impulses which
are able to produce sudden reversion, and between
actual transforming causes which result directly or
indirectly in the remodelling of a species. Thus,
it is conceivable <i>à priori</i> that reversion may occur
by the action of an inciting cause having nothing
to do with the origin of the phyletically older form.
Temperature can certainly have played no part, or
only a very small part, in the formation of the
perennibranchiate form; nevertheless cold may
well have been one of the inciting causes which
induced the Amblystoma at one time to revert
to the <i>Siredon</i> form, and we cannot at present
consider De Saussure to be incorrect when he
maintains that the low temperature of the Mexican
winter might prevent that transformation (of the
Axolotl into the Amblystoma) which would occur
“in the warm reptile-house” of the Jardin des
Plantes. He supports this view by stating that
“Tschudi has found the Amblystoma” (of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">603</a></span>
another species) “in the hottest parts of the United
States.” “On the Mexican plateau, however, it
snows every winter, and if the lake does not actually
freeze, its temperature must fall very considerably
in the shallowest parts.”</p>

<p>But although this view is not opposed by any
theoretical considerations, I still hold it to be incorrect.
I doubt whether it is temperature that
has brought about the reverse transformation of
the Amblystoma into the Axolotl, or which, according
to De Saussure’s conception, at the present
time prevents the transformation of the Axolotl in
the Lake of Mexico. I doubt this because Amblystomas
are now known from all parts of the United
States as far north as New York, a proof that a
winter cold considerably greater than that of the
Mexican plateau is no hindrance to the metamorphosis
of the Axolotl, and that the genus does not
show itself to be in this respect more sensitive than
our native genera of <i>Salamandridæ</i>.</p>

<p>The following observations of De Saussure, in
which he calls attention to the nature of the
Mexican Lake, appear to me to be more worthy of
consideration:&mdash;“The bottom of this lake is
shallow, and one passes imperceptibly from the
lake into extensive marshy regions before reaching
solid ground; perhaps this circumstance makes
the Axolotl incapable of reaching dry land, and
prevents the transformation.”</p>

<p>In any case the Lake of Mexico offers very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">604</a></span>
peculiar conditions for Amphibian life. My
esteemed friend Dr. v. Frantzius has called my
attention to the fact that this lake&mdash;as well as many
other Mexican lakes&mdash;is slightly saline. At the
time of the conquest of Mexico by Ferdinand
Cortez, this circumstance led to the final surrender
of the city, as the Spaniards cut off the supply of
water to the besieged, and the water of the lake is
undrinkable. The ancient Mexicans had laid down
water-conduits from the distant mountains, and the
city is still supplied with water brought through
conduits.</p>

<p>Now this saltness cannot in itself be the cause
of the degeneration to the perennibranchiate form,
but it may well be so in combination with other
pecularities of the lake. The narrowest part of the
lake is the eastern, and it is only in this part that
the Axolotl lives. Now in winter, violent easterly
gales rush down from the mountains and blow
continuously, driving the water before them to such
an extent that it becomes heaped up in the western
portion of the lake, where it frequently causes
floods, whilst 2000 feet of the shallow eastern
shore are often laid completely <span class="locked">dry.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a></span></p>

<p>Now if we consider these two peculiarities, viz.
salineness and periodical drying up of a part of the
bottom of the lake through continuous gales, we
certainly have for the Axolotl, conditions of life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">605</a></span>
which are only to be found in few species. One
might certainly attempt to apply these facts in a
quite opposite sense, and to regard them as
unfavourable to my theory, since the retreat of the
water from a great portion of the bottom of the
lake would&mdash;so one might think&mdash;rather facilitate
transition to a life upon land, and indeed compel
the adoption of such a mode of existence. But
we should thus forget that the exposed bottom of
the lake is a sterile surface without food or place
of concealment, and, above all, without vegetation;
and further, that owing to the considerable salineness
of the water (specific gravity = 1.0215),<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> the
whole of the exposed surface must be incrusted
with salt, a circumstance which would render it
quite impossible for the creatures to feed upon
land. Sodic chloride and carbonate are dissolved
in the water in such considerable quantities, that
they are regularly deposited upon the shores of
the lake as a crust, which is collected during the
dry season of the year and sent into the market
under the name of “tequisquite” (Mühlenpfordt).<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a></p>

<p>Thus the supposition is not wanting in support,
that peculiar conditions make it more difficult for
the creature to obtain its food upon land than in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">606</a></span>
the water, and this alone may have been sufficient
to have induced it to acquire the habits of a purely
aquatic existence, and thus to revert to the perennibranchiate
or Ichthyodeous form.</p>

<p>But enough of supposition. We must not complain
that we are unable from afar to discover with
precision the causes which compelled the Axolotl
to abandon the Amblystoma stage, as long as we
are not able to explain the much nearer cases of
reversion in Filippi’s and Jullien’s Tritons; nevertheless,
in these cases also, the causes affecting
the whole colony of Tritons must be general,
since&mdash;at least in the case noticed by Filippi&mdash;the
greater majority of the individuals remained in the
larval condition. Experiments with Triton larvæ
could throw greater light upon this subject; it
would have in the first place to be established
whether reversion could be artificially induced, and
if so, by what influences.</p>

<p>From the previously mentioned experiments with
butterflies, as well as from the results obtained with
Axolotls, we should expect that in Tritons, reversion
to the Ichthyodeous form would take place if we
allowed the inciting cause, viz. the bathing of the
gills and of the whole body with water, to act persistently,
and at the same time withheld that influence
under whose action the salamander form
became developed, viz. the bathing of the gills,
the skin, and the surfaces of the lungs with air.</p>

<p>Old experiments of this kind are to be met with,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">607</a></span>
but they were never carried on for a sufficient time
to entirely allay the suspicion, that the specimens
concerned would perhaps have undergone the
ordinary metamorphosis if their existence had been
prolonged.</p>

<p>Thus, <span class="locked">Schreibers<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a></span> relates that “by confining
tadpoles of the salamander found at large in their
last stage of growth, under water by means of an
arrangement (net?), and feeding them with finely
chopped earthworms, he was able to keep them for
several months&mdash;and indeed throughout the winter&mdash;in
this condition, and in this way to forcibly defer
their final change, and their transition from the tadpole
stage to that of the perfected creature during
this period.” It is not stated whether the animals
finally underwent transformation, so that it cannot be
decided whether we have here a case of reversion
or simply one of retarded development. That
metamorphosis may occur after a long period of
time, is shown by experiments upon the tadpole
of <i>Pelobates</i> conducted by Professor Langer in
<span class="locked">Vienna.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a></span> The creatures were kept in deep water
in such a manner that they were not able to land,
and by this means three out of a large number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">608</a></span>
of individuals had their metamorphosis delayed
till the second summer; notwithstanding this,
transformation then occurred.</p>

<p>It cannot be objected to my reversion hypothesis,
that it opposes on the one side what on the other
it postulates, viz. a <i>per saltum</i> change of structure.
Reversion is characterized by the sudden acquisition
of an older, <i>i.e.</i> a formerly existing phyletic
stage. That reversion occurs is a fact, whilst
nobody has hitherto been able to prove, or even to
make probable, that a stage of the future (<i>sit
venia verbo</i>) has been attained at once (<i>per
saltum</i>).</p>

<p>Now if it is possible to find influences in the
present conditions of life of the Axolotl which make
it difficult or quite impossible for it to live upon
land, and which therefore appear as incentives to
the reversion to the Ichthyodeous form, the other
portion of my hypothesis&mdash;the assumption that the
Axolotl had become an Amblystoma at a former
period&mdash;can also be supported by facts.</p>

<p>We know from <span class="locked">Humboldt<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a></span> that the level of
the Lake of Mexico at a comparatively recent
period was considerably higher than at present.
We know further that the Mexican plateau was
covered with forest, which has now been destroyed
wherever there are human, and especially Spanish
settlements. Now if we suppose that at some
post-glacial period the mountain forests extended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">609</a></span>
to the borders of the lake, at that time deep, with
precipitous sides and much less saline, not only
should we thus have presented different conditions
of life to those at present existing, but also such
as would be most favourable for the development
of a species of salamander.</p>

<p>On the whole, I believe that my attempt to
explain the exceptional metamorphosis of the
Axolotl of the Mexican lake cannot be objected to
as being a too airy phantasy. In any case it is the
only possible explanation which can be opposed to
that which supposes that the occasional transformation
of the Axolotl is not reversion, but an
attempt at advancement. This last assumption
must, in my judgment, be rejected on purely
theoretical grounds by those who hold that a
sudden transformation of a species, when connected
with adaptation to new conditions of life, is
inconceivable&mdash;by those who regard adaptation,
not as the sudden work of a magic power, but as
the end result of a long series of natural, although
minute and imperceptible causes.</p>

<p>If my interpretation of the facts be correct, there
arises certain consequences which I may here
briefly mention in conclusion.</p>

<p>First, with regard to more obvious results. If
<i>Siredon Mexicanus</i>, Shaw, only by occasional reversion
assumes the Amblystoma form, and never,
or only exceptionally, propagates as such, but only
as <i>Siredon</i>, the more recent systematists are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">610</a></span>
justified in striking out the genus <i>Siredon</i> and in
placing <i>S. Mexicanus</i> as an undeveloped form in
the genus <i>Amblystoma</i>. So long as there exists
not one only, but several species of <i>Siredon</i> which
as such regularly propagate themselves, the genus
exists; and although we would not deprive systematists
of all hope of these species of <i>Siredon</i>
being one day re-elevated to <i>Amblystomæ</i>, it nevertheless
better accords with the actually existing
state of affairs if we allow the genus <i>Siredon</i> to
remain as before among the genera of <i>Salamandrina</i>,
and to include therein all those species
which, like the Paris Axolotl, <i>S. Mexicanus</i>, Shaw,
and probably also <i>S. Lichenoides</i>, Baird, only exceptionally,
or through artificial influences, assume
the Amblystoma form, but without propagating
regularly in this condition. On the other hand, we
should correctly comprise under the genus <i>Amblystoma</i>
all those species which propagate in this
state regularly, and in which the perennibranchiate
stage occurs only as a larval condition.</p>

<p>To arrive at a decision in single cases would
chiefly concern the American naturalists, whose
ever increasing activity may lead us to hope soon
for a closer investigation of the reproduction of
the numerous species of <i>Amblystoma</i> of their
native country. I should rejoice if the facts and
arguments which I have here offered should give
an impetus to such researches.</p>

<p>The second consequence to which I may refer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">611</a></span>
is of a purely theoretical nature, and concerns a
corollary to the “fundamental biogenetic law”
first enunciated by Fritz Müller and Haeckel.
This, as is well known, consists of the following
law:&mdash;The ontogeny comprises the phylogeny,
more or less compressed and more or less modified.</p>

<p>Now according to this law, each step in phyletic
development when replaced by a later one, must
remain preserved in the ontogeny, and must therefore
appear at the present time as an ontogenetic
stage in the development of each individual. But
my interpretation of the transformation of the
Axolotl appears to stand in contradiction to this,
since the Axolotl, which at a former period was an
Amblystoma, retains nothing of the latter in its
ontogeny. The contradiction is, however, only
apparent. As long as we are concerned with an
actual advance in development, and therefore with
the attainment of a new step never formerly
reached, the older stages will be found in the
ontogeny. But this is not the case when the new
stage is not an actual novelty, but formerly represented
the final stage of the individual development;
or, in other words, when we are concerned
with the reversion, not of single individuals, but of
the species as such, to the preceding phyletic
stage, <i>i.e.</i> with a phyletic degeneration of the
species. In this case the former end-stage of the
ontogeny would be simply eliminated, and we
should then only be able to recognize its former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">612</a></span>
existence by its occasional appearance in a reversion
form. Thus, under certain conditions the
Triton sinks back to the perennibranchiate stage;
not in such a manner that the individual first
becomes a Triton and then undergoes perennibranchiate
re-modification, but simply, as I have
already shown above, by its remaining at the
Ichthyodeous stage and no longer attaining to the
Salamander form. So also, according to my
hypothesis, the salamandrine <i>Amblystoma Mexicanum</i>,
formerly inhabiting the shores of the
Lake of Mexico, has degenerated to the perennibranchiate
stage, and the only trace that remains
to us of its former developmental status is the
tendency, more or less retained in each individual,
to again ascend to the salamander stage under
favourable conditions.</p>

<p>The third and last consequence which my interpretation
of the facts entails, is the change in
the part played by reversion in organic nature.
Whilst atavistic forms have hitherto been known
only as isolated and exceptional cases, interesting
indeed in the highest degree, but devoid of significance
in the course of the development of organic
nature, a real importance in this last respect
must now be attached to them.</p>

<p>I may assume that reversion can in two ways
be effectual for the preservation or re-establishment
of a living form. In the first place, where,
as in Axolotl, the new and organically higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">613</a></span>
form becomes untenable through external influences,
instead of simply perishing&mdash;since advancement
in another direction does not appear to
be possible&mdash;a reversion of the species to the
older and more lowly organized stage occurs. In
the second place, the older phyletic form may
not be abandoned while a newer form is being
developed therefrom, but the former may alternate
with the latter, as we see in the case of seasonally
dimorphic butterflies. It can hardly be objected
if I regard the alternation of the summer and
winter form in this case as a periodic reversion to
the phyletically older (winter) form.</p>

<p>Although the reversion of an entire species,
such as I suppose to have been the case with the
Axolotl, may be of rare occurrence, this is certainly
not the case with periodic or cyclical reversion;
the latter plays a very important part in
the development of the various forms of alternating
or cyclical <span class="locked">propagation.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Postscript.</span></h4>

<p>In the previous portion of this essay it was
pointed out that the causes to which I attributed
the reversion of the hypothetical <i>Amblystoma
Mexicanum</i> to the existing Axolotl, did not appear
to me to amount to a complete explanation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">614</a></span>
of the phenomenon. In the first place these
seemed to me too local, since they could only be
applied with any certainty to the Axolotl of the
lake of the Mexican capital, whilst the Paris
Axolotls obtained from other parts of Mexico
still required an explanation. On the other hand,
these causes did not appear to me sufficiently
cogent. Should we even learn subsequently that
the Paris Axolotl is also derived from a salt lake
which is exposed to similar winds to the Lake of
Mexico, we still have in this peculiarity of the
lakes only a cause tending to make it difficult for
the larva to undergo metamorphosis, and to reach
a suitable new habitat on the land. The impossibility
of doing this, or the complete absence of
such habitat, does not however follow as a necessary
consequence.</p>

<p>It would obviously be a much more solid support
for my hypothesis if it were possible to point
to some physical conditions of the land which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">615</a></span>
there precluded the possibility of the existence of
Amblystomas.</p>

<p>For a long time I was indeed unable to discover
such causes, and I therefore concluded the previous
portion of this essay and went to press.
Afterwards, when residing in one of the highest
valleys of our Alps in the Upper Engadine, an
idea accidentally occurred to me, which I do not
now hesitate to regard as correct after having
tested it by known facts.</p>

<p>It happens that in the Upper Engadine there
live only such Amphibia as persistently, or at
least frequently resort to the water. I found
frogs up to nearly 7000 feet above the sea, and
Tritons at 6000 feet (Pontresina and Upper
Samaden). On the other hand, the land-living
mountain salamander, <i>S. Atra</i>,<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> was absent, although
suitable stations for this species were
everywhere present, and it would have wanted for
food as little as do its allies the water-newts.
Neither would the great elevation above the sea
offer any obstacle to its occurrence, since it occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">616</a></span>
ascends to a height of 3000 metres
(Fatiot).<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a></p>

<p>Now it is well known that the atmosphere of
the Upper <span class="locked">Engadine,<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a></span> like that of other elevated
Alpine valleys enclosed by extensive glaciers, is
often extraordinarily dry for a long period, a condition
which appears to me to explain why the
black land-salamander is there <span class="locked">absent,<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a></span> whilst its
near water-living ally occurs in large numbers.
The skin of the naked Amphibia generally requires
moisture, or else it dries up, and the creature is
deprived of a necessary breathing apparatus, and
often dies as rapidly as though some important
internal organ had been removed. Decapitated
frogs hop about for a long time, but a frog which
escapes from a conservatory and wanders about
for one night in the dry air of a room, is found the
following day with dry and dusty skin half dead in
some nook, and perhaps perishes in the course of
another day if left without moisture.</p>

<p>All that we know of the biology of the Amphibia
is in accordance with this. Thus, all the land-salamanders
of southern Italy avoid the hot and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">617</a></span>
dry air of summer by burying in the ground, where
they undergo a summer sleep. This is the case
with the interesting <i>Salamandrina Perspicillata</i>,<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a>
and with the land-living Sardinian Triton, the
remarkable <i>Euproctus Rusconii</i>, Gené,<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> (<i>Triton
Platycephalus</i>, Schreiber). With respect to <i>Geotriton
Fuscus</i> I learn from Dr. Wiedersheim, who
has studied the life conditions of this, the lowest
European Urodelan, in its own habitat, that in
Sardinia it sleeps uninterruptedly from June till
the winter; whilst on the coast of Spezia and at
Carrara, where it also occurs, it avoids the summer
sleep in a very peculiar manner. It makes use of
the numerous holes in the calcareous formation of
that region, and for some months in the year
becomes a cave-dweller. As soon as the great
heat occurs, often in May, it withdraws into the
holes, and again emerges in November during the
wet weather. In these lurking holes it does not
fall into a sleep, but is found quite active, and
its stomach, filled chiefly with scorpions, shows
that it goes successfully in search of food; the
moist air of the holes makes it unnecessary for it
to bury in the earth.</p>

<p>In the same sense it appears to me must be
conceived the fact that the solitary species of frog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">618</a></span>
of the Upper Engadine, <i>Rana Temporaria</i>,<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> the
brown grass frog, is there much more a frequenter
of the water than in the plains. It is true that I
can find no remark to this effect in the excellent
work of Fatiot, already referred to above, and I
am therefore obliged to resort to my own observations,
which, although often repeated, have always
been carried on for only a short time. I was
much struck with the circumstance that the Engadine
frogs were to be found in numbers in the
water long after the pairing season, which, according
to Fatiot, lasts at most to the end of June.
In the numerous pools around Samaden I found
them in July and August, whilst in the plains they
only take to the water at the time of reproduction,
and seek winter quarters in the mud on the first
arrival of this season. (Fatiot, p. 321.) In the
Engadine they have therefore in some measure
adopted the mode of life of the aquatic frogs, but
this of course does not prevent them from returning
in damp weather to their old habits and
roving through meadows and woods.</p>

<p>After these considerations had made it appear
to me very probable that the dry air of the Upper
Engadine accounted for the absence of the black
land-salamander, the question at once arose
whether the absence of Amblystomas from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">619</a></span>
Mexican plateau might not perhaps be due to the
same cause, <i>i.e.</i> whether such a dryness of the
atmosphere might not perhaps prevail also in that
region, so that Amphibia, or at least salamander-like
Amphibia, could not long exist on the land.
The height above the sea is still greater (7000
to 8000 feet), and the tropical sun would more
rapidly dessicate everything in a country poor in
water.</p>

<p>As I was at the time without any books that
might have enlightened me on the meteorological
conditions of Mexico, I wrote to Dr. v. Frantzius,
who, by many years residence in Central America
was familiar with the climate of this region, and
solicited his opinion. I received the reply that
on the high plains of Mexico an extraordinary
dryness of the atmosphere certainly prevails.
“The main cause of the dryness of the high
plains is to be found in the geographical position,
the configuration of the land, and the
physical structure. The north-eastern trade-wind
drives the clouds against the mountains,
on the summits of which they deposit their
moisture, so that no vapour is carried over;
as long as the north-east trade-wind blows, the
streams feeding the rivers flowing into the Atlantic
Ocean are abundantly fed with water, whilst
on the western slopes, and especially on the high
plains, the clouds give no precipitation. In the
second half of the year also, during our summer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">620</a></span>
the so-called rainy season brings but little <span class="locked">rain<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a></span>&mdash;little
in comparison with the more southern regions,
where the heavy tropical thunderstorms daily
deluge the earth with water. Mexico lies much
too northerly, and does not reach the zone of
calms, within which region these tropical rains
are met with.”</p>

<p>Thus, in the high degree of dryness of the air
lasting throughout the year, I do not doubt that
we have the chief cause why no Amblystomas
occur on these elevated plains; they simply cannot
exist, and would become dried up if taken there,
supposing them not to be able to change their
mode of life and to take to the water. If therefore
in former times Amblystomas inhabited
Mexico, the coming on of the existing climatic
conditions left them only the alternative of becoming
extinct, or of again taking to the aquatic
life of their Ichthyodeous ancestors. That this
was not <i>directly</i> possible&mdash;that the Amblystoma
form was not able to become aquatic without a
change of structure, is shown by the fact that
even in the Lake of Mexico no Amblystoma
occurs. A retreat to an aqueous existence could,
as it appears, only be effected by complete reversion
to the Ichthyodeous form, which then also
took place.</p>

<p>But my hypothesis of the transformation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">621</a></span>
Axolotl not only requires the proof that Amblystomas
cannot exist under present conditions in
Mexico, but also the further demonstration that at
a former period other conditions prevailed there,
and these of such a nature as to make the
existence of land-salamanders possible.</p>

<p>With respect to my question, whether we might
not perhaps assume that at some post-glacial
period the conditions of atmospheric moisture on
the high plains of Mexico were essentially different
from those at present prevailing, I recollected Dr.
v. Frantzius and the above-quoted observation of
<span class="locked">Humboldt’s,<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a></span> who discovered in the neighbourhood
of the Lake of Tezenco (Mexico) distinct
evidence of a much higher former level of the
water. “All such elevated plains were certainly
at a former period so many extensive water-basins,
which gradually became filled, and are still filling
up with detritus. The evaporation from such
large surfaces of water must at that time have
caused a very moist atmosphere, favourable to
vegetation and adapted for the life of naked
Amphibia.”</p>

<p>From this side also my hypothesis thus receives
support, and we may assume with some certainty
that at the beginning of the diluvial <span class="locked">period<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a></span> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">622</a></span>
woods surrounding the Mexican lakes were inhabited
by Amblystomas, which, as the lakes subsequently
became more and more dried up and the
air continually lost moisture, found it more difficult
to exist on the land. They would at length
have completely died out, had they not again
become aquatic by reversion to the Ichthyodeous
form. It may perhaps be supposed that the
above-mentioned physical conditions&mdash;desolate,
salt-incrusted shores&mdash;co-operated in the production
of the reversion, by making it difficult for
the larvæ to quit the water; but we can only judge
with certainty upon this point when, by means of
experiment, we have discovered the causes which
produce reversion in the Amphibia.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Addendum.</span></h4>

<p>I have lately met with another interesting
notice on the reproduction of the native North
American Amblystomas. Professor Spence F.
Baird, of Washington, has often observed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">623</a></span>
development from the egg of various species, and
especially of <i>Amblystoma Punctatum</i> and <i>A. Fasciatum</i>.
His observations do not appear to be as
yet published, so that I was unable to discover
any account of the development of <i>Amblystoma</i> in
existing <span class="locked">literature.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a></span> I am authorized to extract
the following brief data from a letter addressed to
Dr. v. Frantzius.</p>

<p>In order to deposit their eggs the Amblystomas
go into the water, where the eggs are laid enclosed
in a jelly-like mass, but never more than fifteen to
twenty together. The spherical eggs are very
large, perhaps a quarter of an inch in diameter.
They soon develop into a <i>Siredon</i>-like larva, which
remains several months in this condition. The
gills then shrivel up, the creature begins to crawl,
and gradually passes through the different transformations
to the complete Amblystoma form.</p>

<p>It appears from this communication that the
Amblystomas lay much larger and much fewer
eggs than the Axolotl, and that their development
throughout resembles that of our salamanders.</p>

<p>In concluding I may mention an anatomical
fact which most strongly supports my view that
the Mexican Axolotl is a reverted Amblystoma.
I learn from Dr. Wiedersheim that the Axolotl
possesses the “intermaxillary gland” which occurs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">624</a></span>
in all the land Amphibia. This organ, lying in the
intermaxillary cavity, appears, whenever it occurs,
to produce a kind of birdlime, <i>i.e.</i> a very glutinous
secretion, which serves to attach the prey to
the rapidly protrusible tongue. Although this
secretion may perhaps also have another function,
from the absence of the intermaxillary gland in all
exclusively aquatic Amphibia, it follows that it
must be devoid of importance for, and inapplicable
to feeding in the water. The intermaxillary gland
is absent in all <i>Perennibranchiata</i> and <i>Derotremata</i>
which Wiedersheim has hitherto investigated,
viz. in <i>Menobranchus</i>, <i>Proteus</i>, <i>Siren</i>,
<i>Cryptobranchus</i>, <i>Amphiuma</i>, and <i>Menopoma</i>, all
of which are indeed without the cavity in which
the gland is situated in the <i>Salamandrina</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
the <i>cavum intermaxillare</i>.</p>

<p>Now in the <i>Salamandrina</i> the gland appears
at an early stage. It is possessed in a well-developed
state by the larvæ both of species of
<i>Triton</i> and of <i>Amblystoma</i>, where indeed the
glandular structure completely fills the <i>cavum
intermaxillare</i>.</p>

<p>Were the Axolotl a species retarded in phyletic
development, the presence of a gland which does
not occur in any other <i>Perennibranchiata</i>, and
which is only of use for life upon land, would be
quite inexplicable.</p>

<p>The matter becomes still more enigmatical
through the fact that the gland, although present,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">625</a></span>
is quite rudimentary. Whilst in the <i>Salamandrina</i>
the capacious intermaxillary cavity is entirely
filled by the tubes of the gland in question,
in Axolotl this cavity is almost completely filled
with a closely woven connective tissue, in which
there can only be found a small number of gland-tubes&mdash;in
the extreme front, and at the base immediately
over the intermaxillary teeth&mdash;these
tubes agreeing in the details of their histological
structure with the elements of the same gland
in the <i>Salamandridæ</i>.</p>

<p>I give these anatomical details from Dr.
Wiedersheim’s verbal communication. An amplified
account will subsequently appear in another
<span class="locked">place.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a></span></p>

<p>An explanation of this rudimentary intermaxillary
gland in the Axolotl only appears to me possible
on the supposition that the latter is an atavistic
form. From this point of view it is evident that
the gland already present in all <i>Amblystoma</i>-larvæ
must have been taken over by the perennibranchiate
form of the existing Axolotl, through
the reversion of the hypothetical <i>Amblystoma
Mexicanum</i> of the “diluvial <span class="locked">period.”<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a></span> It can
also be easily understood that this organ would
become more and more rudimentary in the course
of time, since it has no further use in the water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">626</a></span>
and the gap thus arising in the formerly present
<i>cavum intermaxillare</i> would become filled with
connective tissue.</p>

<p>While the German edition of this work was
going through the press I obtained, through the
kindness of my friend Dr. Emil Bessels of
Washington, the Mexican memoir upon the new
<span class="locked">Axolotl,<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a></span> which even in Mexico regularly, or at
least in many cases, becomes developed into the
Amblystoma form.</p>

<p>The facts are briefly as follows:&mdash;The small
Lake of Santa Isabel is some hours’ journey from
the Mexican capital. In this lake there lives a
species of Axolotl which had hitherto remained
unknown, and was described by Señor Velasco as
<i>Siredon Tigrinus</i>. This species propagates itself
indeed in the Axolotl state, but in many cases it
becomes transformed into Amblystoma and takes
to the land. Although propagation in the Amblystoma
condition was not observed, it can hardly be
doubted that it also propagates in this form.</p>

<p>At first sight these facts appear to refute my
hypothesis, that the extreme dryness of the air of
the Mexican plateau precludes the existence of
land Amphibia. Nevertheless I do not abandon
this hypothesis for the former one, since a closer
study of the data furnished by Velasco confirms
rather than refutes my supposition.</p>

<p>Velasco expressly corroborates the statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">627</a></span>
that the Axolotl hitherto known from the great
Mexican lake which never dries up (Lake of
Xochimilco and Chalco), is only met with in its
native habitat in the <i>Siredon</i> form, <i>i.e.</i> as <i>Siredon
Humboldtii</i>. According to Velasco the cause of
the frequent assumption of the Amblystoma form
by the new <i>Siredon Tigrinus</i>, is to be found in the
local conditions of life of this species. The Lake
Santa Isabel is shallow, its greatest depth amounting
to three meters, and it is liable to a periodical
drying up, which is so complete that one can pass
dry-shod through it in several places. The species
must therefore have long since died out had it
not been able to adapt itself periodically to a
land life. Now it could have become transformed
into a land Amphibian&mdash;as Señor Velasco observed&mdash;at
various stages of growth; and indeed
this author believes that “the Creator has implanted
an instinct in this creature,” which enables
it to always undergo metamorphosis at the right
time.</p>

<p>This last assumption may or may not be taken
as correct, but this much is established, viz. that
numerous individuals of this species take to the
land, and remain there during a period of many
months.</p>

<p>But does this contain the proof that salamander-like
animals are actually able to lead a land life in
Mexico&mdash;that the dry air is advantageous, or at
least supportable to them? It does not appear so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">628</a></span>
to me, but rather that all which has been reported
of this Amblystoma by Señor Velasco goes to
show that the animal does not, properly speaking,
live upon land like the North American Amblystomas,
or like our land-salamanders, but that <i>it
only experiences a summer sleep lasting over the
period of drought</i>. These Amblystomas were
observed as they left the dried-up lake at night in
order to seek some moist lurking-place in the
neighbourhood, where they might remain concealed.
They are only known in the villages
situated near the lake, and were only seen there at
large just when they were wandering from the lake
to their place of concealment. At other times
they were mostly found in the earth, buried under
walls, the pavement of the market-place, &amp;c.
When laying down a line of railway, a workman
found in the earth a whole nest of twelve Amblystomas
lying close together. All these are not
mere lurking-holes which could be abandoned at
any moment; it would rather appear that we have
here places of refuge for the entire duration of the
period of drought, and that these would only be
forsaken when the water of the rainy season penetrated
the soil. I am not myself in a favourable
position for investigating these suppositions more
closely, but this could be done by Señor Velasco,
who lives in Mexico, and science would be much
indebted to him if he would examine as precisely
as possible into the habits and conditions of life of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">629</a></span>
this, and of the other species of Mexican Axolotls.
Unfortunately this gentleman can, it would appear,
have seen only the French publications upon
the transformation of the Axolotl, and could not
therefore have asked himself questions arising
from my conception of the facts; otherwise many
of his observations would have led to more definite
results. The above conclusion can however be
still further supported by Señor Velasco’s data.</p>

<p>One might indeed insist that with us also the
land-salamanders conceal themselves in moist
places during dry weather, and often lie hidden,
as in Mexico, in a hole, in a cluster of as many as
ten together; but with us they leave their lurking-place
from time to time and go in search of food.
Señor Velasco mentions nothing with respect to
this. What especially struck me was the statement
that the Mexican Amblystomas <i>were also to
be found in the water</i>.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> When Lake Santa Isabel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">630</a></span>
is drained, the fishermen stretch large nets across
the exit channels, and in these they not only find
ordinary Axolotls, but also some “<i>sin aretes</i>,”
which they also designate “<i>mochos</i>,” <i>i.e.</i> hornless
Axolotls, because they have no gills, but have
already reached the Amblystoma stage. Our
land-salamanders live in the water only as larvæ,
but they also love and require moisture. Only the
female enters the water when she wants to deposit
her young (eggs with mature larvæ), and then only
at the margin of shallow pools or small brooks.
The Mexican Amblystoma thus much more resembles
in its habits our water-salamanders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">631</a></span>
(Tritons), which remain in the water at least during
the whole period of reproduction. These also
leave the water later, and, like the land-salamander,
seek concealment in the earth. They have this
habit also in those districts which possess a very
dry atmosphere; and especially in the Engadine,
where I first conceived the idea of taking into
account the dryness of the air, I found in the
pools at the end of August and the beginning of
September only larvæ of Tritons. The older
Amphibians must therefore have been on the land,
presumably in their places of winter concealment.</p>

<p>From what we have hitherto learnt from Señor
Velasco, the mode of life of <i>Amblystoma Tigrinum</i>
must resemble that of our Tritons, although its
structure is that of a land-salamander. I would
thus offer the following explanation of the facts at
present known:&mdash;Owing to the periodic drying up
of the lake of Santa Isabel, the <i>Siredon Tigrinus</i>
would be again compelled to undergo metamorphosis.
Whether this was formerly entirely
abandoned, or whether it always occurred in solitary
individuals, is almost immaterial; in any case the
habit of metamorphosis must have been very
rapidly acquired through natural selection, and
must have again become general, if the faculty
was only present in the species, although latent.
Through the dryness of the air, the Amblystomas
that had taken to the land would be compelled to
bury themselves at once, and to remain asleep till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">632</a></span>
the recurrence of the rainy season, when they
would hasten back into the water and would there
live as a species of Triton.</p>

<p>Now one might feel inclined to ask why the
species of the great Mexican lake has not also
taken to this mode of life. To this it may be
simply replied that the water of this lake never
dries up, and that the Axolotls have thus never
been reduced to the alternative of undergoing
metamorphosis or of perishing. If therefore the
conditions of existence in water were more favourable
than on land, the tendency to abandon metamorphosis
would increase from generation to
generation, and the deportment at present observed
would finally result, <i>i.e.</i> propagation would
take place exclusively in the Axolotl state. As
has already been mentioned above, the latest
observations of Velasco furnish further confirmation
that the Axolotl of the great lake is never
met with in the Amblystoma condition, “although
it (the Axolotl) is brought daily from Mexico
into the market throughout the whole year.” I
should not however regard it as a refutation of
my view if prolonged investigation should show
that this species also (<i>Siredon Humboldtii</i>) occasionally
developed into an Amblystoma; on the
contrary, it would not at all surprise me if such
cases of reversion occurred in Mexico as well as
in Europe. The fact that an immense majority of
the Amphibians propagate in the Axolotl state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">633</a></span>
would not be thereby affected, and would still
require an explanation: this I am still inclined to
see in the dryness of the air of the high plains,
which is so unfavourably adapted for a life passed
entirely on land.</p>

<span class="subhead">ON THE MECHANICAL CONCEPTION OF NATURE.</span></h3>

<hr />
<h4 id="P3-4-Intro">INTRODUCTION.</h4>

<p>In the first of the three preceding essays it was
attempted to solve the question whether the transformations
of a given complex of characters in a
certain systematic group could be completely explained
by the sole aid of Darwinian principles.
It was attempted to trace the origin of the marking
and colouring of the Sphinx-caterpillars to individual
variability, to the influences of the environment,
and to the laws of correlation acting within
the organism. These principles as applied to the
origin of a certain well-defined, although narrowly
restricted range of forms, were tested in order to
see whether they were alone sufficient to explain
the transformation of the forms.</p>

<p>It appeared that this was certainly the case.
In all instances, or at least where the facts necessary
to obtain a complete insight were available,
the transformations could be traced to these
known factors; there remained no inexplicable
residual phenomena, and we therefore had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">635</a></span>
reason for inferring the existence of some still
unknown modifying cause lying concealed in the
organism. In this region of the marking and
colouring of caterpillars, the assumption of a
phyletic vital force had to be abandoned, as being
superfluous for the explanation of the facts.</p>

<p>In the second essay the attempt was next made
with reference to double form-relationship, as presented
for observation in metamorphic insects, to
draw conclusions as to the causes of the transformations.
It appeared here that form- and
blood-relationship do not always coincide, since
the larvæ of a species, genus, or family, &amp;c., may
show quite different form-relationships to their
imagines. These facts alone told very decisively
against the existence of an internal developmental
power, so that the latter had likewise to be set
aside by the method of elimination, since the
observed incongruences as well as the congruences
of form-relationship, found sufficient
explanation in the action of the environment on
the organism.</p>

<p>This investigation thus also led to the denial of
a phyletic vital force.</p>

<p>In the third essay I finally sought to prove
that the only case of transformation of one species
into another at present actually <span class="locked">observed<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a></span>, could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">636</a></span>
not without further evidence be interpreted as the
result of the action of a phyletic vital force, but
that more probably we had here only an apparent
case of new formation, which was in reality but a
reversion to a stage formerly in existence.</p>

<p>If this last investigation removes the only
certain observation which could have been adduced
in favour of the hypothesis of a phyletic
vital force, so also do the two former essays show
that this hypothesis, at least in the case of insects,
must be abandoned as inadequate.</p>

<p>The question now arises whether this conclusion,
based on such a limited range of inquiry,
can also be applied to the other groups of the
organic world without further evidence.</p>

<p>The supporters of a principle of organic development
will deny this in each individual case,
and will demand special proof for each group of
organisms; I believe this position, however, to be
incorrect. Here, if anywhere, it appears to me
justifiable to apply the conclusions inductively
from special cases to general ones, since I cannot
at all see why a power of such pre-eminent and
fundamental importance as a phyletic vital force
should have its activity limited to solitary groups<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">637</a></span>
in the organic world. If such a power exists it
must be the inciting cause of organic development
in general, and must be equally necessary in
every part of creation, as no advancement could
take place without it. In this case, however, the
force would be recognizable and demonstrable at
every point; the phenomena should nowhere stand
in opposition to its admission, and should in no
case be explicable or comprehensible without it.
The same laws and forces which caused the development
of one group of forms must underlie
the development of the whole organic world.</p>

<p>I therefore believe that we are correct in applying
to the whole living world the results furnished
by the investigation of insects, and in thus
denying the existence of an innate metaphysical
developmental force.</p>

<p>There is, however, a quite distinct method
which leads to the same results, and to the preliminary,
if not to the complete and definitive
rejection of such a principle; <i>the admission of this
power is directly opposed to the laws of natural
science</i>, which forbid the assumption of <i>unknown</i>
forces as long as it is not demonstrated that
<i>known</i> forces are insufficient for the explanation
of the phenomena. Now nobody will assert that
this has in any case been proved; the test of
applying the known factors of transformation has
only just commenced, and wherever it has been
made they have proved sufficient as causal forces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">638</a></span>
Thus, even without the foregoing special investigations
we should deny a phyletic vital force; the
more so as its admission is fraught with the
greatest consequences, since it involves a renunciation
of the possibility of comprehending
the organic world. We should, on this assumption,
at once cut ourselves off from all possible
mechanical explanation of organic nature, <i>i.e.</i>
from all explanation conformable to law. But
this signifies no less than the renunciation of all
further inquiry; for what is investigation in natural
science but the attempt to indicate the mechanism
through which the phenomena of the world are
brought about? Where this mechanism ceases
science is no longer possible, and transcendental
philosophy alone has a voice.</p>

<p>This conception represents very precisely the
well-known decision of Kant:&mdash;“Since we cannot
in any case know <i>à priori</i> to what extent the
mechanism of Nature serves as a means to every
final purpose in the latter, or how far the mechanical
explanation possible to us reaches,”
natural science must everywhere press the attempt
at mechanical explanation as far as possible.
This obligation of natural science will be conceded
even by those who lay great stress upon the necessity
for assuming a designing principle. Thus,
Karl Ernst von Baer states that we have no right
“to assert of the individual processes of Nature,
even when these evidently lead to a definite result,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">639</a></span>
that some Mind has originated them designedly.
The naturalist must always commence with details,
and may then afterwards ask whether the
totality of details leads him to a general and final
basis of intentional <span class="locked">design.”<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a></span></p>

<p>But even if we are precluded on these grounds
only from assuming the existence of a directive
power, <i>i.e.</i> a phyletic vital force, for explaining
detailed phenomena, and are at the same time
debarred from the possibility of arriving at a physical
or mechanical explanation&mdash;which amounts to
no less than the abandoning of the scientific
position&mdash;it certainly cannot be asserted that the
development of the organic world is already conceived
of as a mechanical process. We rather
acquiesce in the belief that the processes both of
organic and of inorganic nature depend most probably
upon purely causal powers, and that the
attempt to refer these to mechanical principles
should not therefore be abandoned. There is no
ground for renouncing the possibility of a mechanical
explanation, and the naturalist <i>must not</i>
therefore resign this possibility; for this reason he
cannot be permitted to assume a phyletic power so
long as it is not demonstrated that the phenomena
can never be understood without such an assumption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">640</a></span></p>

<p>It cannot be raised as an objection that even
for the explanation of individual life a vital power
was long ago admitted, as there was not then
sufficient material at hand to enable the phenomena
of life to be traced to physical forces. It
is now no longer questionable that this assumption
was a useless error&mdash;a false method&mdash;at the time
when made certainly very excusable, since the
aspect of the question was then, owing to the
imperfect basis of facts, very different to the
present analogous question as to the causes of
derivative development. Thus, although it is now
easy to prove this assumption to be erroneous, it
was in the former sense correct, as it was in
accordance with the existing state of knowledge.
At that time there was hardly one of the numerous
bridges which now connect inorganic with organic
nature, so that the supposition that life depended
upon forces which had no existence outside living
beings was sufficiently near.</p>

<p>In any case the philosophers of that period
cannot be blamed for filling up the gaps in the
existing knowledge by unknown powers, and in
this manner seeking to establish a finished system.
The task of philosophy is different to that of
natural science; the former strives at every period
to set up a completely finished representation of
the universe in accordance with the existing state
of knowledge. Natural science on the other hand
is only concerned in collecting this knowledge;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">641</a></span>
she need not therefore always finish off, and
indeed can never close her account, since she will
never be in a position to solve all <span class="locked">problems.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a></span> But
science must not for this reason pronounce any
question to be insoluble simply because it has not
yet been completely solved; this she does, however,
as soon as she renounces the possibility of
a mechanical explanation by invoking the aid of a
metaphysical principle.</p>

<p>That this is the correct mode of scientific
investigation is seen by the abandoning of the
(ontogenetic) vital force. The latter is no longer
admitted by anybody, now that we have turned
from mere speculation to the investigation of
Nature’s processes; nevertheless its non-existence
has not been demonstrated, nor are we yet in a
position to prove that all the phenomena of life
must be traced to purely physico-chemical processes,
to say nothing of our being actually able
to thus trace them. Von Baer also states “that
the abolishment of the vital force is an important
advance; it is the reduction of the phenomena of
life to physico-chemical processes, although these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">642</a></span>
indeed still contain many gaps.” He points out
how very far we are still removed from being able
to reduce to physical causes, the processes through
which the fertilized yelk of an egg becomes developed
into a chicken.</p>

<p>How comes it therefore that we all have a conviction
that such a complete reduction will in time
become possible, or if not this, that the development
of the individual depends entirely upon the
same forces which are in operation without the
organism? For what reason have we rejected the
“vital force”?</p>

<p>Simply because we see no reason for assuming
that known forces are insufficient for explaining
the phenomena, and because we are not justified
in admitting directive forces as long as we have
any hope of one day furnishing a mechanical
explanation.</p>

<p>But if it is not only permissible, but even necessary,
to explain the <i>ontogenetic</i> vital power by
known forces, and to commence to indicate the
mechanism which produces the individual life,
why should it not be equally necessary to abandon
that assumption of a <i>phyletic</i> vital force which
stifles any deeper inquiry, and to attempt to point
out that here also the co-operation of mechanical
forces has brought about the multitudinous and
wonderful phenomena of the organic world?</p>

<p>The renunciation of the old vital force was
certainly an immediate consequence of the acquisition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">643</a></span>
of new facts&mdash;of the knowledge that the
same compounds which compose organic bodies
can be produced without the latter. This discovery,
due to Wöhler and his followers, showed
that organic products could be prepared <span class="locked">artificially.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a></span>
In brief, the decline of the vital force
followed from the knowledge that at least one
portion of the processes of life was governed by
known forces.</p>

<p>But in the domain of the development of the
organic world have we not quite analogous proofs
of the efficacy of known forces? Is not the
<i>variability</i> of all types of forms a fact? and
must not this under the action of natural selection
and heredity lead to permanent changes? Has
not the problem of explaining the subserviency of
all organic form to law as a <i>result</i> without invoking
its aid as a <i>principle</i> been thus successfully
solved? It is true that we have not directly
observed the process of natural selection from
beginning to end; neither has anybody directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">644</a></span>
observed the mode in which the heat of the
animal body is generated by the processes of
combustion going on in the blood and in the
tissues; nevertheless, this is believed as a certainty,
and a “vital force” is not invoked.</p>

<p>Now the above-mentioned Darwinian principles
of transmutation are certainly not simple forces of
nature like those underlying the development of
the individual, <i>i.e.</i> chemico-physical forces, and
it cannot be said <i>à priori</i> whether in one of these
principles&mdash;perhaps in variability or in correlation&mdash;there
may not lie concealed a metaphysical
principle in addition to the physical
forces. In fact it has lately been asserted by
Edward von <span class="locked">Hartmann<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a></span> that the theory of selection
is not a mechanical explanation, since it
combines forces which are only partly mechanical
and in part directive.</p>

<p>It must therefore be next investigated whether
this assertion is tenable.</p>

<h4 id="P3-4-I">I.<br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Are the Principles of the Selection
Theory Mechanical?</span></span></h4>

<p>Edward von Hartmann may justly claim that
his views should be considered and tested by
<span class="locked">naturalists.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a></span> He would be correctly classed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">646</a></span>
those philosophers who have approached this
question with a many-sided scientific preparation.
It can nevertheless be perceived in his case how
difficult, and indeed how impossible, it is to estimate
the true value of the facts furnished by the
investigation of nature, when we attempt to take
up only the results themselves, without being
practised in the methods by which these are
reached, <i>i.e.</i> without being completely at home
in one of the scientific subjects concerned through
one’s own investigations. It appears to me that
the denial of the purely mechanical value of the
Darwinian factors of transformation arises in most
part from an erroneous classification of the scientific
facts with which we have to deal. There can
certainly be no mistake that the entire philosophical
conception of the universe, as laid down
by Von Hartmann in his “Philosophy of the Unconscious,”
is unfavourable to an unprejudiced estimate
of scientific facts and to their mechanical
valuation.</p>

<p>Variability, heredity, and above all correlation,
would not be regarded by Von Hartmann as purely
mechanical principles, but he would therein assume
a metaphysical directive principle.</p>

<p>In the first place, as regards variability, Von
Hartmann endeavours to show that it is only a
quite unlimited variability which suffices for the
explanation of necessary and useful adaptations
by means of selection and the struggle for existence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">647</a></span>
But this does not exist&mdash;variation rather
takes place in a fixed direction only (in Askenasy’s
sense), and this can be nothing else than the
expression of an innate law of development, <i>i.e.</i> a
phyletic vital force.</p>

<p>This deduction appears to me in two ways
erroneous. In the first place it is incorrect that
a quite unlimited variability is a postulate of the
theory of selection, and in the next place the
admission of variability, which is in a certain sense
“fixed in direction,” does not necessitate the
assumption of a phyletic vital force.</p>

<p>A mere unsettled variability, uniform in all
possible directions, is, according to Von Hartmann,
necessary for the theory of selection, because only
then does the variability offer a certain guarantee
“that under given conditions of life the variations
necessary for complete adaptation will not be
wanting.” But it is hereby overlooked that the
new life conditions to which the adaptation must
take place are as little fixed and unchangeable as
the organism itself. In such a case of transformation
we have not to deal with a type of organization
which was before fixed and immutable,
and which has to be squeezed into new life-conditions
as into a mould. The adaptation is not
one-sided, but mutual; a species in some measure
selects its new conditions of life, corresponding
with those possible to its organization, <i>i.e.</i> with
the variations actually occurring. I will choose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">648</a></span>
an instance which will even be conceded by Von
Hartmann as being only explicable by natural
selection, viz., a case of mimicry.</p>

<p>Supposing that among the South American
<i>Heliconiidæ</i> there occurred a species of <i>Pieris</i>
which had no resemblance to these protected
butterflies, either in form, marking, or colouring;
who can deny that it would be most useful to this
species to acquire the form and colouring of a
Heliconide, and thus, by taking to new conditions
of life, to avoid the persecutions of its foes? But
if the physical nature of the Pieride concerned
precluded the occurrence of Heliconoid variations,
would this incapability of insinuating itself into
these new conditions necessitate the decline of the
species? Could not its existence be secured in
some other manner? could not the destruction of
numerous individuals by foes be compensated for
by increased fertility? to say nothing of the
numerous other means through which the number
of surviving individuals might become increased,
and the existence of the species secured. This
case is not arbitrarily chosen; in the districts
where the <i>Heliconiidæ</i> occur there are actually a
large number of Whites which do not possess the
protective colours of the former nauseous family.
In the adoption of these new life conditions we
have not to deal therefore with survival or extermination,
but only with amelioration. It is not
every species of “White” that can become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">649</a></span>
adapted to these conditions, because every species
does not give rise to the necessary colour variations;
those that do, become in this way modified,
because they are thus better protected than before.
And so it is throughout; wherever we find protected
insects enjoying immunity from foes we see
also mimickers, sometimes only single, sometimes
several, and generally from very diverse groups of
insects, according to the general resemblance
which existed before the commencement of the
process of adaptation, and to the variations made
possible by the physical nature of the species concerned.</p>

<p>In the first essay of the second part of this
work it was shown that in certain Lepidopterous
larvæ a process of adaptation is at the present
time still in progress, this depending upon the fact
that while the young caterpillar is very well protected
by the leaf-green colour of its body, this
colour becomes insufficient to conceal the insect
as soon as it exceeds the leaf in size. All such
caterpillars&mdash;and there is a whole series of species&mdash;as
they increase in size acquire the habit of
concealing themselves on the earth by day, and
of feeding only at night. New conditions of life
are thus imposed, and these are even compulsory,
<i>i.e.</i> they could not be abandoned without
risking the existence of the species. Now in
accordance with these new conditions, some individuals
in these species have lost the green colouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">650</a></span>
of the young stages, and have acquired the
brown coloration of the dark surroundings of the
insects which conceal themselves by day. In one
species this change has now occurred in almost
all individuals, in others in only a larger or smaller
proportion of them. Now supposing that among
these species there occurred one, the physical
nature of which did not admit of the production of
brown shades of colour, would the species for this
reason succumb? Is it not conceivable that the
want of colour adaptation might be compensated
for by better concealment, <i>i.e.</i> by burrowing into
the earth, or by a greater fertility of the species,
or by the development of warning signals&mdash;supposing
the species to be unpalatable&mdash;or finally,
by the acquisition of a terrifying marking? In
other words, could not the caterpillar itself modify
the new condition of life&mdash;that of being concealed
by day&mdash;in accordance with variations made
possible by its physical nature?</p>

<p>As a matter of fact in one of these species the
green colour remains unchanged in spite of the
altered mode of life, and this species, wherever it
occurs, notwithstanding the persecution of entomologists,
is always common (<i>Deilephila Hippophaës</i>);
it conceals itself better and deeper however
than those other species which, like <i>Sphinx
Convolvuli</i>, are difficult to detect on account of
their brown colour. In another species the striking
yellowish green colouring is likewise retained in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">651</a></span>
the majority of individuals, but this species buries
itself by day in the loose soil (<i>Acherontia Atropos</i>).</p>

<p>To this it may be objected that there are also
compulsory changes in the conditions of life from
which the species cannot withdraw itself, but in
which adaptation must necessarily follow, or extermination
would take place.</p>

<p>Such compulsory conditions of life do most
assuredly occur, and there is indeed no doubt that
many living forms have perished through not
becoming transformed. I believe, however, that
such conditions occur much more rarely than one
is inclined to admit at first sight. As a rule the
alternative of immediate change or of extermination
is offered only by such changes in the conditions
of life as occur very rapidly. The sudden
appearance of a new and dominant enemy, such
as man, has already caused the extinction of
the Dodo (<i>Didus ineptus</i>), and of Steller’s Sea
Cow (<i>Rhytina Stelleri</i>), and of other vertebrate
animals, and constantly leads to the extermination
of many other species of different classes. When
in America hundreds of thousands of acres of
primeval forest are annually destroyed, the conditions
of life of a numerous fauna and flora must
be thereby suddenly changed, leaving no choice
but extermination.</p>

<p>Such abrupt changes in the conditions of life
occur, however, but seldom in nature unless
caused by man, and must therefore have very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">652</a></span>
rarely happened in former epochs of the earth’s
history. Even climatic changes, which we might
at first regard as of this character, and which produce
a modification in one fixed direction, occur
always so gradually that the species has time
either to adapt itself to the conditions in this or
that direction, according to the variations possible
to its physical nature, or else to emigrate.</p>

<p>It thus appears to me erroneous to suppose
that variability must be “merely undetermined”
in order to complete its part in Darwin’s theory of
selection, and its “illimitedness” seems to me also
as little necessary for this purpose. Von Hartmann
imagines that it is only unlimited variability
that furnishes a guarantee that any type, to whatever
extent diverging from its point of departure,
will be reached by the Darwinian method of
gradual transmutation by means of selection and
the struggle for existence.</p>

<p>But who has ever asserted that <i>any</i> type can
be reached from any point? Or if anybody has
said such nonsense, who can prove that its admission
is necessary for the theory of selection?
Nowhere in systemy do we see any point of
support for such an assumption. But when Von
Hartmann imagines that the “unlimited” variability
which he postulates for Darwin “is in itself
unlimited, the limits of its divergence in a given
direction being found, not in itself, but only in
external obstacles,” he conceives variability to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">653</a></span>
something independent of, and in some way added
to, the animal body, and not a mere expression
for the fluctuations in the type of the organism.
If, however, we conceive variability in this latter,
the true scientific sense, it is in no way “quantitatively
unlimited,” nor are its limits even determined
by <i>external</i> influences, but essentially by
<i>internal</i> influences, <i>i.e.</i> by the underlying physical
nature of the organism. Darwin has indeed
already shown this in a most beautiful manner in
his investigations upon the correlations of organs
and systems of organs of the body. To make
use of a metaphor, the forces acting within the
body are in equilibrium; if one organ becomes
changed this causes a disturbance in the forces,
and the equilibrium must be restored by changes
in other parts, and these again entail other modifications,
and so forth. Herein lies the reason
why the primary change cannot exceed a certain
amount if the restoration of the equilibrium is not
to be quite impossible. This is but a metaphor,
and I do not wish to assert that we are at present
in a position to formulate and demonstrate mathematically
for any particular case, how much an
organ can become changed in any one species
before an interruption of the internal harmony of
the body takes place. But such impossibility of
demonstration does not appear to me to furnish a
sufficient reason for regarding variability as the
expression of a directive power&mdash;as an “innate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">654</a></span>
tendency to variation conformable to <span class="locked">law.”<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a></span> On
the contrary, it is to me easily conceivable that
we only learn to analyse the processes of nature
in detail very slowly, because of their necessary
complexity. It thus appears to me quite useless
when in this sense Wigand makes use of the
objection, that “the gooseberry has not undergone
any enlargement since 1852, although it is
inconceivable why it should not attain the size of
a pumpkin if variability was not internally limited.”
It may well be that this is for the present “inconceivable;”
nevertheless, this does not justify us
in setting up a hypothetical “force of variation”
which will not admit of the gooseberry surpassing
the pumpkin in size. We are bound to maintain
that it is the action and reaction of known forces
which sets a limit to the enlargement of this fruit.</p>

<p>In more simple instances the causes of such
limitations to growth can be well perceived.
Several decades have passed since Leuckart
proved in how exact a relation the proportion of
volume and surface stood to the degree of organization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">655</a></span>
of an animal. In animals of a spherical
form the surface is quite sufficient for respiration,
so long as they are of microscopic size. But
such an organism cannot become enlarged at
pleasure, because the ratio of the surface to the
volume would become quite different. The surface
increases as the square, whilst the volume increases
as the cube, so that very soon the surface
of the more rapidly increasing bodily mass can
no longer suffice for <span class="locked">respiration.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a></span> This sort of
limitation is in no way equivalent to that purely
external kind which, for instance, manifests itself
in such a manner as to prevent the indefinite
lengthening of the tail feathers of the Bird of
Paradise. In this case feathers that were too
long would hinder flight, and such individuals
would accordingly be eliminated by natural selection.
The cause is in the former case purely
internal, depending upon the equilibrium of the
forces governing the organism.</p>

<p>Von Hartmann is entirely in the right when he
asserts that variability is neither qualitatively nor
quantitatively unlimited. In both senses it is
limited (in direction as well as in amount) by the
physico-chemical forces acting in some contrary
way in each specific organism&mdash;by the physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">656</a></span>
nature of each living form. He errs, however,
both in making absolute illimitability a necessary
postulate of the theory of selection, as also in
inferring the existence of a directive principle
from that limitation of variability which is certainly
present. “Tendencies to variation” do
however exist, not in the sense of a directive
power, but as expressions of the different physical
constitutions of species, which necessarily cause
unequal reactions to the same external actions, as
will be more clearly proved <span class="locked">below.<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a></span></p>

<p>This is, of course, a modification of Darwin’s
original assumption of an unbounded variability
not limited in direction; but Darwin himself has
later coincided in the view that the quality of
the variations is essentially determined by the
nature of the <span class="locked">organism.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">657</a></span></p>

<p>I now turn to the consideration of the second
factor of the theory of selection&mdash;heredity. This
also, according to Von Hartmann is not a mechanical
principle. Darwin himself has now
become convinced how great is the probability
against the hereditary retention of modifications
which, whether feebly or strongly pronounced,
appear <i>only in single individuals</i>, <i>i.e.</i> of those
so-called “fortuitous” variations which are not the
expression of a directive developmental principle.
“But as among the numberless possible directions
of an indefinite variability, useful modifications can
only occur in single cases, Darwin has by this
supplementary admission himself retracted an
inadmissible assumption of his theory of selection,”
and so forth. A “regular, designed
tendency to variation, acting from within and
contemporaneously affecting a large number of
individuals,” must therefore be assumed “in
order to insure the by itself improbable inheritance.”</p>

<p>But even from the unbounded variability laid
down by the author, it by no means follows that
useful variations can only occur in single individuals.
In the whole category of <i>quantitative</i>
variations the reverse is always the case. Is it
the lengthening of some part that is concerned;
so would a large number of individuals always
possess the useful variation, since we are not
dealing with an <i>absolute</i> enlargement, but only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">658</a></span>
with the fact that the part concerned is longer
than in other <span class="locked">individuals.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a></span></p>

<p>But if <i>qualitative</i> variations come into consideration,
it may be asked whether Darwin’s
“supplementary admission” does not go too far.
Such calculations as those quoted by Darwin
from the article in the <i>North British Review</i> of
March 1867 are extremely deceptive, since we
have no means of measuring the amount of protection
afforded by a useful variation, and we can
therefore hardly compute with any certainty, in
how great a percentage of individuals a change
must contemporaneously occur in order to have a
chance of becoming transferred to the following
generation. If our blue rock-pigeon could exist
in a polar climate, and if we had the power of
introducing it gradually, but not suddenly, into
these regions in a wild state, who can doubt
that it would assume the white colour of all
polar animals? Nevertheless, among wild rock-pigeons
white varieties do not occur more frequently
than among swallows, crows, or magpies.
Or must the white colour of polar animals, the
yellow colour of desert species, and the green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">659</a></span>
colour of leaf-frequenting forms, be always referred
to a “regular, designed, fixed tendency to
variation acting from within,” and causing a
“large number of individuals” to vary in a similar
manner?</p>

<p>There is, however, a grain of truth in the foregoing;
variations which occur singly have but
little chance of becoming predominant characters,
and this is obviously what Darwin concedes. But
this is by no means equivalent to the assumption
that only those variations which from the first
occur in numerous individuals have a chance of
being perpetuated. Let us keep to the facts.
We have not the slightest reason either for regarding
the white colour of polar animals as the
direct action of cold, or for considering that the
green colour of foliage-living caterpillars depends
upon direct action arising from the habit of
resting upon the <span class="locked">leaves;<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a></span> both these characters
are explicable only by natural selection, and there
is nothing to favour the assumption (which Von
Hartmann postulates as necessary for success)
that many individuals varied into white at the
same time. We know no single extra-polar
species of a dark colour which frequently, <i>i.e.</i> in
many individuals of every generation, varies into
white, but we know many species which from time
to time produce single white individuals. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">660</a></span>
when, on the other hand, we find that all polar
animals to which the white coloration is advantageous,
and indeed none but species of which
the nearest allies vary only individually into white,
possess this colour, must we not conclude from
this alone that <i>single</i> variations can, under
favourable conditions, become predominant characters?</p>

<p>It appears to me that in this question one
weighty factor has been too little regarded, even
by the supporters of the selection theory, viz., the
slowness of most, and especially of climatic
changes, which I have already insisted upon. If
the transformation of a temperate into an arctic
climate occurred so rapidly that the species exposed
to it had the alternative either of becoming
white in ten or twenty generations or of being
unable to exist, then the hasty intervention of a
directive power could alone save them from extermination
by causing hundreds of thousands of
individuals to become similarly coloured with all
speed. But it is quite different if the change of
climate takes place only in the course of several
thousand generations; and this, according to the
geological evidence, must have been the true state
of the case.</p>

<p>Let us take a definite example&mdash;the well-known
one of the hare. With us this animal remains
brown in the winter and but seldom produces
white varieties, whilst its ally the Alpine hare is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">661</a></span>
white during seven months of the year, the Norwegian
hare during nine months, and the Greenland
hare throughout the whole year. If our
climate became transformed into an arctic one,
after a given time there would arrive a period
when the older coloration no longer possessed
any advantage over the occasional and singly-appearing
white variations; the winter days during
which the ground was covered with snow would
have become so numerous, that the protection
afforded to the white animals would be equal to
the protection enjoyed by the brown individuals
on the equally numerous days free from snow.
From this time forth the hares that were white in
winter would not be subjected to a greater decimation
by foxes, &amp;c., than the brown individuals.
This period must however be represented as consisting
of one or more centuries, and it would be
strange if from the individual white hares, which
now had an equal chance of existing, some white
families did not become established. But the
state of affairs would gradually become reversed&mdash;the
brown hares would experience greater decimation,
and wherever there were white families
these would possess an advantage in the struggle
for existence. It does not follow that the dark
individuals would be forthwith extirpated; on the
contrary, the advantage in favour of the white
would be but small throughout a long period of
time, and these individuals would only gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">662</a></span>
increase to a higher percentage of the total
population; nevertheless their numbers would
constantly but very slowly augment. In the
course of time this increase would become more
rapid for two reasons&mdash;first, because even a very
small advantage in favour of the increasing
number of individuals would always leave a
greater number of these victorious; and secondly,
because on the whole as the climate became more
arctic, the advantage of being white would continually
become more decisive in determining
which should live and which should succumb.</p>

<p>Thus I see no reason why individual variations
which do not appear only once, but which frequently
recur in the course of generations, should
not acquire predominance under favourable conditions.
All facts are in accord with this. Even
the common hare shows us that it would be quite
capable of becoming coloured in a similar manner.
In the museum of Stuttgart there are three specimens
of <i>Lepus timidus</i>, killed in Wurtemburg,
which are completely white, and several others
which are silver-grey or spotted with white. In
eastern Russia the common hare possesses a
light grey, almost white, winter coat, and <span class="locked">Seidlitz<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a></span>
makes known the interesting observation
that such light specimens occur <i>singly</i> in Livonia,
where “the common hare has become naturalized
since the commencement of the century.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">663</a></span></p>

<p>As I have already insisted upon above, from
the point of view of the conditions of life there is
no reason for assuming rapid transformations;
the change of conditions is almost always extremely
slow; and indeed in numerous instances
no objective change occurs, but simply a subjective
one, if we may thus designate those cases
in which the alteration in the conditions of life
depends upon a change in the animal form which
is undergoing transformation, and not in that of
the environment. This is the case in the above-mentioned
instances of mimicry, where the whole
change in the conditions of life arises from one
species becoming similar to another. The process
of natural selection has here as long a period
of time as it requires to perfect its results. It is
quite similar in all cases of special protective
adaptations of form and colour. In all these it is
always <i>improvement</i> that is concerned, and not the
question “to be or not to be” with which we
have to deal.</p>

<p>It is just cases of this last kind, however,
which are best fitted for exposing the improbability
and insufficiency of the assumption of a
variational tendency as a distinct directive power.
We have only to fix our attention upon some particular
case of sympathetic colouring, or, still
better, of mimicry. A “tendency to variation”
implies that a large number of individuals produce
varieties resembling the model to be imitated, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">664</a></span>
this&mdash;at least according to Von Hartmann&mdash;must
take place in each of the successive generations,
so that by this means, combined with heredity,
the useful variation becomes increased. But how
comes it that this “tendency to variation” coincides
with the existence of the model both in time and
place? Can this be due to accident if the two
have not a common cause? The upholders of a
directive power will certainly not admit this; so
that there remains only Leibnitz’s assumption of a
pre-established harmony contained in the first organic
germ, which, after innumerable transformations
of the organic form and after millions of years,
gave rise in the midst of the Amazonian region to an
inedible Heliconide with certain yellow, black, and
white markings on the wings, and at precisely the
same time developed the tendency in a Pieride at
the same spot on the globe to imitate this Heliconide
as a model!</p>

<p>In addition to this assumption, which is
certainly but little worthy of consideration, there
is perhaps one other remaining, viz., that all or
many Pierides and other species of butterflies
possessed the same tendency to a Heliconoid
variation and were always everywhere striving to
develop this type, but succeeded only where they
accidentally coincided in time and place with the
model, the “tendency” being thus furthered by
natural selection. But the facts negative this
assumption, since such imitative variations have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">665</a></span>
never been observed to a perceptible extent in
other <span class="locked">species.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a></span></p>

<p>All variations which are demonstrably useful
can be similarly dealt with if their origin is explained
by variational tendencies.</p>

<p>We perceive that the objection which Von
Hartmann brings against heredity is only valid on
the ground that this process affords no security
for the preservation of variations which occur
singly. That heredity itself is a mechanical process
is not directly disputed; it is simply assumed
that new characters can be transferred by inheritance
only when they are produced by the
metaphysical “developmental principle,” and not
when they arise “accidentally.” This critic does
not therefore direct his attack against heredity,
but rather against the mechanical origin of variability.</p>

<p>Von Hartmann might have said here that a
reference of the phenomenon of heredity to purely
mechanical causes, <i>i.e.</i> a mechanical theory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">666</a></span>
heredity, is up to the present time wanting. That
he has not done so proves on the one hand that
he despised the dialectical art, but, on the other
hand, that he himself has not overlooked the subserviency
of the total phenomenon to law, and
that he grants the possibility of finding a mechanical
explanation therefor. If, in fact, the
power of inheritance does not depend upon
mechanical principles, I know not what organic
processes we are entitled to regard as mechanical,
since they are all dependent in essence upon
heredity, with which process they are at one, and
from which they cannot be thought of as isolated.
Haeckel correctly designates reproduction as surplus
individual growth, and accordingly refers the
phenomena of heredity to those of growth. Conversely,
growth may also be designated reproduction,
since it depends upon a continuous process
of multiplication of the cells composing the
organism, from the germ-cell to the innumerable
congeries of variously differentiated cells of the
highly developed animal body. Who can fail to
see that these two processes, the reproduction of
the germ-cell and its offspring in the economy of
the individual, and the reproduction of individuals
and species in the economy of the organic world,
show an exact and by no means simply superficial
analogy?<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> But whoso grants this must
also conceive both processes to depend upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">667</a></span>
same cause&mdash;he cannot assume for the one a
causal power and for the other a directive
principle. If nutrition and cell-multiplication are
purely mechanical processes, so also is heredity.
Although it has not yet been possible to demonstrate
the mechanism of this phenomenon, it can
nevertheless be seen broadly that by means of a
minimum of living organic matter (<i>e.g.</i> the protoplasm
of the sperm and germ-cell) certain motions
are transferred, and these can be regarded as
directions of development, as I have already
briefly laid down in a former <span class="locked">work.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a></span> The power
of organisms to transmit their properties to their
offspring appears to me to be only conceivable in
such a manner “that the germ of the organism
by its chemico-physical composition together with
its molecular structure, has communicated to it a
fixed direction of development&mdash;the same direction
of development as that originally possessed
by the parental organism....” (<i>loc. cit.</i> p.
24). This is confessedly nothing more than a
hint, and we do not learn therefrom the means by
which developmental direction can be possibly
transferred to another organism.</p>

<p>Recently Haeckel, that indefatigable pioneer to
whom we are indebted for such a rich store of
new ideas, has attempted to bridge over this gap
in his essay on “The Perigenesis of the Plastidule,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">668</a></span>
Berlin, 1876. The basic idea, that heredity
depends upon the transference of motion, and
variability upon a change of this motion, completely
corresponds with the conviction gained in
the province of physical science, that “all laws
must finally be merged in laws of motion”
(Helmholtz<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a>). I hold this view to be the more
completely justifiable&mdash;although certainly not in
the remotest degree as proved&mdash;because I
formerly designated the acquired individual variations
as the “diversion of the inherited direction
of development.” Haeckel’s hypothesis in so far
accomplishes more than Darwin’s pangenesis, in
which a transference of matter, and not of a
species of motion peculiar to this matter, is
assumed. But although the germ of a mechanical
theory of heredity may be contained in Haeckel’s
hypothesis, this nevertheless appears to me to be
somewhat remote from completely solving the
problem. It brings well into prominence one
portion of the process of inheritance; under the
image of a molecular motion of the plastidule,
which motion is modifiable by external influences,
we can well understand the fact of a change
gradually taking place in the course of generations.
On the other hand, the assumption of
consciousness in the plastidule,&mdash;however admissible
philosophically&mdash;although only as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">669</a></span>
formula, scarcely furnishes any deeper knowledge.
In the light of a theory, detailed instances which
were formerly obscure should become comprehensible.
I fail to see, however, how the
various forms of atavism, <i>e.g.</i> the reversions which
so commonly occur by crossing different races,
become more comprehensible by assuming consciousness
in the plastidule. If in both parents
the plastidule long ago acquired different molecular
motions, why, in its rencounters in the germ,
does it recollect past times and reassume the
older and long abandoned motion? That it does
acquire the latter is indeed a fact if we once refer
the directional development of the individual to
molecular motion of the plastidule; the wherefore
does not appear to me, however, to become
clearer by assuming consciousness in the plastidule.
A mechanical theory of heredity must
rather be able to show that the plastidule movements
of the male and female germ-cells, in their
rencounter in the case of the crossing of widely
divergent forms, become mutually modified in
such a manner that the motion of the common
ancestral form must occur as the resultant. To
such demonstration there is however as yet a long
step. Haeckel himself moreover points out that
his hypothesis is by no means a “mechanical
theory of heredity,” but only an introduction to
this theory, which he hopes “will be capable of
being elevated to the rank of a genetic molecular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">670</a></span>
theory” (<i>loc. cit.</i> p. 17). But although we must
also confess with the critic of the “Philosophy of
the Unconscious,” that “the facts of heredity have
hitherto defied every scientific <span class="locked">explanation,”<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a></span>
this furnishes us with no excuse for flying to a
metaphysical explanation, “which is here certainly
least able to satisfy the inability to understand
the connection arising from natural laws.”</p>

<p>It is not to be wondered at that Von Hartmann,
on the ground of the “Unconscious” on which he
takes his stand, speaks of the law of correlation
as an unconscious acknowledgment of a “non-mechanical
universal principle on the side of
Darwinism.” By “correlation” he understands
something quite different to the idea which we
attach to this expression. He supposes that
“Darwinism sees itself compelled to acknowledge
through empirical facts the uniform correlation of
characters pertaining to the specific type; but it
thereby contradicts its mechanical principles of
explanation, all of which amount to the same
thing as conceiving the type as a mosaic,
chequered, superficial, and accidental aggregate
of characters, which have been singly acquired,
contemporaneously or successively, by selection
or habit.” I do not believe, however, that any
such conception has ever been admitted either by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">671</a></span>
Darwin or any one else. The admission that not
all, but only every deep-seated <i>physiological</i> detailed
modification, is or may be bound up with a
system of correlated changes, indeed implies that
we on our side also acknowledge an internal
harmony of parts&mdash;an equilibrium, as I have above
expressed it.</p>

<p>But does this include the admission of a teleological
principle, or exclude a mechanical explanation?
Do we thereby acknowledge a “specific
type” in the sense of an inseparably connected
complex of characters, none of which can be taken
away without all the others becoming modified?
Does such a view agree generally with the empirical
facts?</p>

<p>Neither of these views appears to me to represent
the case.</p>

<p>I will first answer the second question. On all
possible sides the earlier view of the absolute
nature of species is contradicted; there is no
boundary between species and varieties. But
when Von Hartmann assumes that by the transformation
of one species “into another” the
“whole uniformly connected complex must become
changed,” he falls back into the old
doctrine of the absolute nature of species, which
is sharply contradicted by multitudes of facts.
We not unfrequently observe varieties which
differ from the parent-form by only a single
character, whilst others show numerous differences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">672</a></span>
and again others may be seen in which the
differences predominate. This last deviation
would then be designated by many systematists
as a new species, but not so by others.</p>

<p>The “specific type” is thus indeed a kind of
mosaic-work, but it is a structure to which all the
single characters&mdash;the stones of the mosaic&mdash;belong
and build up one harmonious whole, and
not a meaningless confusion. Some of the stones
or groups of stones can be taken away and replaced
by others differently coloured without the
structure being thereby necessarily distorted, <i>i.e.</i>
destroyed as a structure; but the larger the stones
which are exchanged the more necessary will
corrections in the other parts of the structure
become, in order that the harmony of the whole
may be preserved.</p>

<p>Still more weighty than those insensible transitions
which in various groups of animals so
frequently connect species with species, appear
to me, however, the facts made known in the
second essay of the second part of this volume,
which prove that the two forms in which one
species appears can change entirely independently
of one another. The caterpillar changes and
becomes a new variety or even species (according
to the form-value of the change), whilst the
butterfly remains unaltered. How could this
occur if some other law than that of physiological
equilibrium linked together the parts or characters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">673</a></span>
and permitted them to become severed?
Must not the two stages become changed with
and through one another, like the parts of one
body, since they first together constitute the
specific type? Is not the fact of this not happening
a proof that the whole “uniformly connected
complex” of the specific type is not bound and
held together by a metaphysical principle, but
simply by natural laws?</p>

<p>Now when Von Hartmann comprises the relations
of different species to one another under
the idea of correlation, such for instance as the
relation of dependence in which orchidaceous
flowers stand with respect to the insects which
visit them, he completely abandons the scientific
conception which should be associated with this
expression, and compares together two heterogeneous
things which have nothing in common
excepting that they are both considered by him as
a result of the “Unconscious.” The consequence
which is then deduced from this correlation of his
own construction, viz., that an organic law of
correlation is only another expression for a “law
of organic development” in the sense of a metaphysical
power, obviously cannot be admitted.</p>

<p>By correlation we understand nothing more
than the dependence of one part of the organism
upon the others and the mutual inter-relations of
these parts, which depend entirely upon a “physiological
relation of dependence,” as Von Hartmann<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">674</a></span>
himself has correctly designated it. Herein is
evidently comprised the total morphology of the
organism&mdash;the structure as a whole, the length,
thickness and weight of the single parts, as well
as the histological structure of the tissues, since
upon all these depends the performance of the
single parts. But when, under correlation, Von
Hartmann comprises “also a morphological,
systematic, inter-action of all the elements of the
organism with reference both to the typical
ground-plan of the organization as well as to the
microscopic anatomical structure of the tissues,”
he drags into the idea something foreign to it, not
on the ground of facts, but actually in opposition
to them, and supported only by a supposed
“innate developmental principle” which “is not
of a mechanical nature.”</p>

<p>The living organism has already been often
compared with a crystal, and the comparison is,
<i>mutatis mutandis</i>, justifiable. As in the growing
crystal the single molecules cannot become
joined together at pleasure, but only in a fixed
manner, so are the parts of an organism governed
in their respective distribution. In the crystal
where nothing but homogeneous parts become
grouped together their resulting combination is
likewise homogeneous, and it is obvious that they
offer but very little possibility of modification, so
that the governing laws thus appear restricted
and immutable. In the organism, whether regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">675</a></span>
microscopically or macroscopically, various
parts become combined, and these therefore offer
numerous possibilities of modification, so that the
governing laws are more complex, and appear less
restricted and unchangeable. In neither instance
do we know the final causes which always lead to
a given state of equilibrium; in the case of a
crystal it has not occurred to anybody to ascribe
the harmonious disposition of the parts to a teleological
power; why then should we assume such
a force in the organism, and thus discontinue the
attempt, which has already been commenced, to
refer to its natural causes that harmony of
parts which is here certainly present and equally
conformable to law?</p>

<p>On these grounds the assertion that the theory
of selection is not an attempt at a “mechanical”
explanation of organic development appears to
me to be incorrect. Variability and heredity, as
well as correlation, admit of being conceived as
purely mechanical, and must be thus regarded so
long as no more cogent reasons can be adduced
for believing that some force other than physico-chemical
lies concealed therein.</p>

<p>But we certainly cannot remain at the purely
empirical conception as laid down by Darwin in
his admirable work on the “Origin of Species.”
If the theory of selection is to furnish a method
of mechanical explanation, it is essential that its
factors should be formulated in a precise mechanical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">676</a></span>
sense. But as soon as we attempt to do this
it is seen that, in the first enthusiasm over the
newly discovered principle of selection, the one
factor of transformation contained in this principle
itself has been unduly pushed into the background,
to make way for the other more apparent and
better known factors.</p>

<p>I have for many years insisted that the first, and
perhaps most important, or in any case the most
indispensable, factor in every transformation, is <i>the
physical nature of the organism itself</i>.<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a></p>

<p>It would be an error to believe that it is entirely
the external conditions which determine what
changes shall appear in a given species; the
nature of these changes depends essentially upon
the physical constitution of the species itself, and
a modification actually arising can obviously be
only regarded as the resultant of this constitution
and of the external influences acting thereon.</p>

<p>But if an essential or perhaps even a preponderating
share in determining new characters is to be
undoubtedly ascribed to the organism itself, for
a mechanical representation of organic developmental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">677</a></span>
processes everything depends upon our
being able to conceive this most important factor
in a definite theoretical manner, and to comprise
under one common point of view its apparently
contradictory manifestations of constancy and
variability.</p>

<p>Now every change of considerable extent is
certainly considered by Darwin to be the direct or
indirect consequence of external actions; but indirect
action always presupposes a certain small
variability (individual variability), without which
larger modifications cannot be brought about.
Empirically this small amount of variability is
doubtless present, but the question arises, upon
what does it depend? Can it be conceived as
arising mechanically, or is it perhaps just at this
point that the metaphysical principle steps in and
offers those minute variations which make possible
that course of development which, according to
this view, is immutably pre-determined? It is
certainly the absence of a theoretical definition of
variability which always leaves open a door for
smuggling in a teleological power. A mechanical
explanation of variability must form the basis of
this side of the theory of selection.</p>

<p>This explanation is not difficult to find. All
dissimilarities of organisms must depend upon the
individuals having been affected by dissimilar external
influences during the course of the development
of organic nature. If we ascribe to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">678</a></span>
organism the power of giving rise by multiplication
only to exact copies of itself, or, more
correctly, the power of transmitting unaltered to
its successors the motion of its own course of
development, each “individual variation” must
depend upon the power of the organism to react
upon external influences, <i>i.e.</i> to respond by
changes of form and of function, and consequently
to modify its original (inherited) developmental
direction.</p>

<p>It has sometimes been insisted upon, that the
“individuals of the same species” or the offspring
of one mother cannot be absolutely equal, because,
from the commencement of their existence, they
have been subjected to dissimilar actions of the
environment. But this implies that by perfectly
equal influences they would become equal, <i>i.e.</i> it
supposes that variability is not inseparably bound
up with the essence of the organism, but is only
the consequence of developmental tendencies
which are in themselves equal being unequally
influenced. As a matter of fact the first germs of
an individual certainly cannot be supposed to be
perfectly equal, because the individual differences
of the ancestors must be contained therein in
different degrees according to their constitution,
and we should have to go back to the primordial
organism of the earth in order to find a perfectly
homogeneous root, a <i>tabula rasa</i> from which the
descendants would commence their development.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">679</a></span>
Whether such a homogeneous root ever existed is
however doubtful; it is much more probable that
<i>numerous</i> organisms first arose <span class="locked">spontaneously,<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a></span>
and these cannot be presumed to have been absolutely
equal, since the conditions under which
they came into life cannot have been perfectly
identical. Let us, however, for the sake of simplicity
assume a single primordial organism; the
first generation which took its rise from this by
reproduction could only have possessed such
individual differences as were produced by the
action of dissimilar external influences. But the
third generation, together with self-acquired,
would also have shown <i>inherited</i>, dissimilarities,
and in each succeeding generation the number of
tendencies to individual difference imparted to the
germ by heredity must have increased to a certain
degree, so that it may be said that all germs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">680</a></span>
from their first origination, bear in themselves a
tendency to show individual peculiarities, and
would develop these even if they should not be
again affected by dissimilar influences. This is
obviously the case, since the youngest egg-cells in
the ovary of an animal are, as can be demonstrated,
always exposed to unequal external conditions
with respect to nutrition and <span class="locked">pressure.<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a></span>
Hence, if it were possible that two germs were
exactly equal with respect to the direction of
development imparted to them by heredity, they
would nevertheless furnish two incongruent individuals;
and if, conversely, it were possible that
two individuals could be exposed to absolutely
the same external influences from the formation
of the embryo, these also could not be identical,
because the individual differences of the ancestors
would entail small differences, even in asexual
reproduction, in the direction of development
transmitted to the egg. The differences between
individuals of similar origin thus finally depend
entirely upon the dissimilarity of external influences&mdash;on
the one side upon those which divert
the development of the progenitors, and on the
other side upon those which divert the individual
itself from its course, <i>i.e.</i> from the developmental
direction transmitted hereditarily. Although I
thus essentially agree with Darwin and Haeckel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">681</a></span>
in so far as these authors refer the “universal
individual dissimilarity” to dissimilar external
actions, I differ from Darwin in this, that I do not
see an essential distinction between the direct
and indirect production of individual differences,
if by the latter is meant only the unequal influencing
of the germ in the parental organism.
Haeckel is certainly correct in referring the
“primitive differences of the germs produced by
the parents” to the inequalities of nutrition to
which the single germs must inevitably have been
exposed in the parent organism; but another
dissimilarity of the germs must evidently be added&mdash;a
dissimilarity which has nothing to do with
unequal nutrition, but which depends upon unequal
inheritance of the individual differences of
the ancestors, a source of dissimilarity which
must arise to a greater extent in sexual than in
asexual reproduction. Just as in sexual propagation
there occurs a blending of the characters (or
more precisely, developmental directions) of two
<i>contemporaneous individuals</i> in <i>one</i> germ, so in
every mode of reproduction there meet together
in the same germ the characters of a whole <i>succession
of individuals</i> (the ancestral series), of
which the most remote certainly make themselves
but seldom felt in a marked degree.</p>

<p>The fact of individual variability can in this way
be well understood; the living organism contains
in itself no principle of variability&mdash;it is the <i>statical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">682</a></span>
element</i> in the developmental processes of the organic
world, and would always reproduce exact
copies of itself if the inequality of the external
influences did not affect the developmental course
of each new individual; these influences are therefore
the <i>dynamical elements</i> of the process.</p>

<p>From this conception of variability two important
empirically established facts can be
theoretically deduced, viz. the limitability of
variation with respect to quality, which has already
been previously mentioned, and the origination of
transformations by the direct action of external
conditions of life.</p>

<p>If the differences in individuals of the same origin
depend upon the action of unequal influences,
variation itself is nothing else than the reaction of
the organism to a definite external inciting cause,
the quality of the variation being determined by
the quality of the inciting cause and by that of
the organism. In the cases of individual variation
hitherto considered, the quality of the organism is
equal but that of the inciting cause is unequal,
and in this way there arise minute differences in
organisms of an equal physical constitution&mdash;variations
of a different quality.</p>

<p>The same result, viz., different qualities of
variation, may also arise in a reverse manner by
organisms of a different physical nature being
affected by equal external influences. The response
of the organism to the cause inciting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">683</a></span>
change would be different according to its nature,
or, in other words, organisms of different natures
react differently when affected by equal modifying
influences. The physical nature of the organism
plays the chief part with respect to the quality of
the variations; each specific organism can thus
give rise to extremely numerous, but not to all
conceivable, variations; that is, only to such variations
as are made possible by its physical
composition. From this it follows further that
the possibilities of variation in two species are
more widely different, the wider they diverge in
physical constitution (including bodily morphology)&mdash;that
a cycle of variation is peculiar to
every species. In this manner we are led to the
knowledge that there must certainly exist a “fixed
direction of variation,” but not in the sense of
Askenasy and Von Hartmann, as the result of an
unknown internal principle of development, but as
the necessary, <i>i.e.</i> mechanical, consequence of the
unequal physical nature of the species, which
must respond even to the same inciting cause by
unequal variations.</p>

<p>The facts, as far as we know them, agree very
well with this conclusion. Allied species vary in
a similar manner, whilst species which are more
distantly related vary in a different manner, even
when acted upon by the same external influences.
Thus, in the first part of these “Studies” I have
remarked that many butterflies under the influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">684</a></span>
of a warm climate acquire an almost black coloration
(<i>Polyommatus Phlæas</i>), whilst on the other
hand others become lighter (<i>Papilio Podalirius</i>).</p>

<p>We can thus understand why always certain
courses of development are followed, a fact which
cannot be completely explained by the nature of
the conditions of life which induce the variations.
But as soon as we clearly perceive that the quality
of the changes essentially depends upon the
physical nature of the organism itself, we arrive
at the conclusion that species of widely diverging
constitutions must give rise to different variations,
whilst those of allied constitutions would produce
similar variations. But definite courses of development
are thus traced out, and we perceive
that from any point of the organic developmental
series, it is impossible that any other point can be
attained at pleasure. Variation in a definite
direction thus by no means necessitates the
acknowledgment of a metaphysical developmental
principle, but can be well conceived as
the mechanical result of the physical constitution
of the organism.</p>

<p>The manner in which the dissimilar physical
constitution of organisms must arise can also be
easily shown, although the first commencement
of the whole developmental series, <i>i.e.</i> the oldest
living forms must be assumed to have been almost
homogeneous in their physical constitution.
The quality of the variation is, as said before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">685</a></span>
not merely the product of the physical constitution,
but the resultant of this and of the quality
of the changing external conditions. Thus from
the first “species” there proceeded, through the
dissimilar influence of external conditions of life,
several new “species,” and as this took place the
former physical nature of the organism at the
same time became changed, necessitating also a
new mode of reacting upon external influences, <i>i.e.</i>
another direction of variation. The difference
from the primary “species” must certainly be conceived
as having been very minute, but it must
have increased with each new transformation, and
must have proceeded exactly parallel with the
degree of physical change connected with each
transformation. Thus, hand in hand with the
modifications, the power of modification, or mode
of reaction of the organism to changing influences,
must have continually become re-modified, and
we finally obtain an endless number of differently
constituted living forms, of which the variational
tendencies are different in exact proportion to
their physical divergence, so that nearly allied
forms respond similarly, and widely divergent
forms very differently, to the same inciting
causes.</p>

<p>Individual variation arises, as I have attempted
to show, by each individual having been
continually affected by different, and indeed by
constantly changing, influences. Let us, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">686</a></span>
imagine on the contrary, that a large group
of individuals is affected by the same influences&mdash;in
fact by such influences as the remaining individuals
of the species are not exposed to: this
group of individuals would then vary in a nearly
similar manner, since both factors of variation, viz.
the external influence and the physical constitution,
are equal or nearly so. Such local
variations would first become prominent when
the same external influence had acted upon a
series of generations, and the minima of variation
produced in the individual by the once-exerted
action of the cause inciting change had become
augmented by heredity. Transformations of
some importance (up to the form-value of species)
can thus arise simply by the direct action
of the environment, in the same way as that in
which individual differences are produced&mdash;only
the latter fluctuate from generation to generation,
since the inciting influences continually change;
whilst, in the former, the constant external cause
inciting modification always reproduces the same
variation, so that an accumulation of the latter
can take place. Climatic varieties can be thus
explained.</p>

<p>A more efficacious augmentation of the variations
arising in the single individual is certainly
brought about by the <i>indirect</i> action of the environment
upon the organism. It is not here my
intention to explain once more the processes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">687</a></span>
natural selection; I mention this only in order to
point out that in these cases transformation
depends upon a <i>double action</i> of the environment,
since the latter first induces small deviations in
the organism by direct action, and then accumulates
by selection the variations thus produced.</p>

<p>By regarding variability in this manner&mdash;by
considering each variation as the reaction of the
organism to an external action, as a diversion of
the inherited developmental direction, it follows
that without a change in the environment no advance
in the development of organic forms can
take place. If we imagine that from any period
in the earth’s history the conditions of life remain
completely unchanged, the species present on the
earth at this period would not, according to our
view, undergo any further modification. Herein
is clearly expressed the difference of this view
from that other one according to which the inciting
principle of modification is not in the environment,
but lies in the organism itself in the form
of a phyletic vital force.</p>

<p>I cannot here refrain from once more returning
to the old (ontogenetic) vital force of the natural
philosophers, since the parallel between this and
its younger sister, the “phyletic vital force”
which appears in so many disguises, is indeed
striking. Were the inciting principle of the
development of the individual actually an independent
vital force acting within the organism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">688</a></span>
the birth and growth of the individual would
be able to take place without the continuous encroachment
of the environment, such as occurs
in nutrition and respiration. Now this is known
to be impossible, so that those who support the
existence of such a force, if any still exist, would
be driven to the obscure idea of a co-operation
between the designing power and the influences
of the environment, just in the same manner as
such a co-operation is at present postulated by
the defenders of the phyletic vital force. I shall
further on take the opportunity of pointing out
that this last idea is quite untenable; with respect
to the (ontogenetic) vital force any clearer proof
cannot well be adduced, but it will be admitted
that the confused notion of the co-operation and
inter-action of teleological and causal powers is,
from our point of view, opposed to those very
simple and clear ideas which are in harmony with
the views on phyletic development. As in racial
development each change of the organic type is
entirely dependent upon the action of the environment
upon the organism, so in the development
of the individual, the totality of the phenomena of
the personal life must depend upon similar actions.
Physiology, as is known, herein entirely supports
our view, since this shows that without the continual
alternating action of the environment and
of the organism there can be no life, and that
vital phenomena are nothing but the reactions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">689</a></span>
the organism to the influences of the environment.</p>

<p>It will be immediately perceived how exactly
the processes of phyletic and of ontogenetic development
coincide, not merely in their external
phenomena but in their nature, if we trace the
consequences of the existing knowledge of the
structure of the animal body. Although we may
not entirely agree with Haeckel’s doctrine of individuality
in its details, its correctness must on
the whole be conceded, since it cannot be disputed
that the notion of individuality is a relative
one, and that several categories of morphological
individuals exist, which appear not only <i>singly</i> as
<i>physiological individuals</i>, <i>i.e.</i> as independent living
beings of lowest grade, but which can also
<i>combine</i> to form beings of a higher order.</p>

<p>But if we admit this, we should see with Haeckel
nothing but reproduction in the origination of a
high organism from a single cell, the egg; this
reproduction being at the same time combined
with various differentiations of the offspring, <i>i.e.</i>
with adaptations of the latter to various conditions
of life. Not even in the fact that the
tissues and organs of a single physiological individual
stand in great dependence upon one
another through physical <span class="locked">causes,<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a></span> is there any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">690</a></span>
striking difference between this view and the
phyletic composition of the animal (and vegetable)
kingdom out of physiological individuals (Haeckel’s
“<i>Bionten</i>”), since contemporaneous animals (individuals
and species) are known to influence one
another in the most active manner.</p>

<p>Now if we further consider that the same units
(cells) which, by their reproduction and division
of labour, at present compose the body of the
highest organism, must at one time have constituted
as independent beings the beginning of the
whole of organic creation, and that consequently
the same processes (division of cells) which now
lead to the formation of a mammal, at that time
led only to a long series of different independent
beings, it will be admitted that both developmental
series must depend upon the same inciting
powers, and that with reference to the causes of
the phenomena it is not possible that any great
gap can exist between ontogeny and phylogeny,
<i>i.e.</i> between the life-phenomena of the individual
and those of the type. According to our view
both depend upon that co-operation of the same
material physical forces which admits of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">691</a></span>
briefly summarized as the reaction of organized
living matter to influences of the environment.</p>

<p>Our opponents either cannot boast of such
harmony in their conception of nature, or else
they must, together with the phyletic vital force,
re-admit into their theory the old ontogenetic
vital force. I know not indeed why they should
not do so. Whoever inclines to the view that
organic nature is governed not merely by causal,
but at the same time by teleological, forces, may
admit that the latter are as effective as inciting
causes of individual, as they are of phyletic, development.
According to my idea they are even
bound to admit this, since it cannot be perceived
why the adaptations of the ontogeny should not
depend upon the same metaphysical principle
assumed for each individual, as the adaptations
of the phylogeny; the latter are indeed only
brought about by the former. I believe therefore
that the vital force (ontogenetic) of the ancients
stands or falls with the modern (phyletic) vital
force. We must admit both or neither, since
they both rest on the same basis, and are supported
or opposed by the same arguments.
Whoever feels justified in setting up a metaphysical
principle where complete proof that
<i>known forces</i> are sufficient for the explanation of
the phenomena has not yet been adduced, must
do the same with respect to individual, as he does
to phyletic, development, since this proof is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">692</a></span>
both cases very far from being complete, and still
contains large and numerous <span class="locked">gaps.<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a></span></p>

<p>The theoretical conception of variation as the
reaction of the organism to external influences
has also not yet been experimentally shown to be
correct. Our experiments are still too coarse
as compared with the fine distinctions which
separate one individual from another; and the
difficulty of obtaining clear results is greatly increased
by the circumstance that a portion of
the individual deviations always depends upon
heredity, so that it is frequently not only difficult,
but absolutely impossible, to separate those which
are inherited from those which are acquired.
Still further are we removed from being able to
refer variation to its final mechanical causes, <i>i.e.</i>
from a mechanical theory of reproduction, which
would bring within the range of mathematical
calculation both the phenomena of stability
(heredity) and of change (variability).</p>

<p>But although sufficient proofs of the correctness
of the views here advocated cannot at
present be adduced, these views are not contradicted
by any known facts&mdash;they are, on the
contrary, supported by many facts which they in
turn make comprehensible (local forms, different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">693</a></span>
cycles of variation in heterogeneous species).
These views are finally completely justified by
their furnishing the only possible theoretical
formulation of variability on which a mechanical
conception of organic development can be based.
That such a conception is not only admissible,
but is unavoidable, at least to the naturalist, I
have already attempted to prove.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">694</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h4 id="P3-4-2">II.<br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Mechanism and Teleology.</span></span></h4>

<p>In the third volume of his smaller works Karl
Ernst von Baer submits the theory of selection
to a most searching examination. Without
actually calling in question its scientific admissibility,
he believes that this theory is dependent
upon its satisfying one condition, viz. that it
should connect the teleological with the mechanical
principle.</p>

<p>“The Darwinian hypothesis, as stated by its
supporters, always ends in denying to the processes
of nature any relation to a future, <i>i.e.</i> any
relation of aim or design. Since such relations
appear to me <i>quite evident</i>,” &amp;c. And further:&mdash;“If
the scientific correctness of the Darwinian
hypothesis is to be admitted, it must accommodate
itself to this universal striving after a purpose.
If it cannot do this we should have to deny its
value.”</p>

<p>These words appear almost equivalent to
passing a sentence of doom upon the theory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">695</a></span>
selection and the mechanical conception of nature,
for how can one and the same process be effected
simultaneously by necessity and by designing
powers? The one excludes the other, and we
must&mdash;so it appears&mdash;take our stand either on
one side or the other.</p>

<p>Nevertheless we cannot set aside Von Baer’s
proposition without further examination simply
because it is apparently incapable of being fulfilled,
since it contains a truth which should not
be overlooked, even by those who uphold the
mechanical theory of nature. It is the same
truth which is also made use of by the philosophical
opponents of this theory, viz. that the
universe as a whole cannot be conceived as having
arisen from blind necessity&mdash;that the endless
harmony revealed in every nook and corner by
all the phenomena of organic and of inorganic
nature cannot possibly be regarded as the work
of chance, but rather as the result of a “vast
designed process of development.” It is also
quite correct when, in reply to the supposed objection
that the mechanical theory of nature is
not concerned with chances but with necessities,
Von Baer answers that the operations of a series
of necessities which “are not connected together”
can only be termed accidents in their opposing
relations. He illustrates this by instancing a
target. If I hit the latter by a well-aimed shot,
nobody would explain this as the result of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">696</a></span>
accident, but if “a horseman is riding along a
gravelly road past this target, and one of the
pebbles thrown up by the hoof of the galloping
horse hits the mark, this would be termed an
accident of extremely rare occurrence. My target
was not the mark for the pebble, therefore
the hit was purely accidental, although the projection
of the stone in this precise direction with
the velocity which it had acquired, was sufficiently
explained by the kick given by the horse. But
the hit was accidental because the kick of the
galloping horse, although it necessarily projected
the pebble, had no relation at all to my target.
For the same reason we must regard the universe
as an immense accident if the forces which move
it are not designedly regulated&mdash;the more immense
because it is not a single motion of projection
that acts here, but a large number of heterogeneous
powers, <i>i.e.</i> a large number of variously
acting necessities which are, as a whole, devoid
of purpose, but which nevertheless accomplish
this purpose, not only at any single moment, but
constantly. A truly admirable series of desirable
<span class="locked">accidents!”<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a></span></p>

<p>The same idea is expressed, although in a very
different manner, by Von Hartmann, in the concluding
chapter of his work already quoted. He
thinks that “design is a necessary and certain
consequence of the mechanical laws of nature.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">697</a></span>
“Were the mechanism of natural laws not teleological
there would be no mechanically regulated
laws, but a weak chaos of obstinate and capricious
powers. Not until the causality of the laws of
inorganic nature had superseded the expression
“dead” nature, and had shown itself as the mainspring
of life and of a conformability to design
visible on all sides, did it deserve the name of
mechanical lawfulness; just as a complication of
wheels and machinery made by man, which move
in some definite manner with respect to one
another, only acquires the name of a mechanism
or of a machine when the immanent teleology of
the combination and of the various movements of
the parts is <span class="locked">revealed.”<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a></span></p>

<p>Against the correctness of the idea underlying
these statements scarcely anything can in my
opinion be said. The harmony of the universe and
of that portion of it which we designate organic
nature, cannot be explained by chance, <i>i.e.</i> without
a common ground for co-operating necessities;
by the side of mere mechanism it is impossible
not to acknowledge a teleological principle&mdash;the
only question is, in what manner can we conceive
this as acting without abandoning the purely
mechanical conception of nature?</p>

<p>This is obviously effected if, with Von Baer and
Von Hartmann, we permit the metaphysical
principle to interrupt the course of the mechanism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">698</a></span>
of nature, and if we consider both the former and
the latter to work together with equal power.
Von Hartmann expressly makes such an admission
under the name of an “internal principle of development,”
to which he attributes such an important
share that one cannot understand why it
should have any need for the employment of causal
powers, and why it does not simply do everything
itself. Von Baer expresses himself much less
decisively, and even in many places insists upon
the purely mechanical connection of organic
natural phenomena; but that with him also the
idea of interruption by a metaphysical principle is
present, is principally shown by his assuming, at
least partly, the <i>per saltum</i> development of species.
This necessarily involves an actively internal
power of development.</p>

<p>Although I have already brought forward many
arguments against the existence of such a power,
and although in refuting it every form of development
by directive powers is at the same time
overthrown, it nevertheless appears to me not to
be superfluous in such a deeply important question
to show that a <i>per saltum</i> development, and
especially the so-called heterogeneous generation,
is inconceivable, not only on the ground of the
arguments formerly employed against the phyletic
vital force in general, but quite independently of
these.</p>

<p>In the first place it must be said that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">699</a></span>
positive basis of this hypothesis is insecure.
Cases of sudden transformation of the whole
organism with subsequent inheritance are as yet
quite unknown. It has been shown that the
occasional transformation of the Axolotl must
most probably be regarded in a different light.
Another case, taken for heterogeneous generation,
viz. the budding of twelve-rayed Medusæ in the
gastric cavity of an eight-rayed species, has
lately been shown by Franz Eilhard <span class="locked">Schulze<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a></span> to
be a kind of parasitism or commensalism. The
buds of the <i>Cuninæ</i> do not spring, as was supposed,
from the <i>Geryonia</i>, but are developed from
a <i>Cunina</i> egg. But even if we recall here the
cases of alternation of generation and heterogenesis,
this would not be of any value by way of
proof; it would only be thus indicated how one
might picture to oneself a sudden transformation.
That in alternation of generation, or generally, in
every mode of cyclical reproduction, we have not
to deal with the abandonment of one type of
organization and the transition to some other, is
proved by the continual return to the type of departure&mdash;by
the cyclical character of the entire
transformation. That two quite heterogeneous
types can belong to one cycle of development is,
however, capable of a far better and more correct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">700</a></span>
explanation than would be given by the supporters
of <i>per saltum</i> development. If we trace cyclical
reproduction to the adaptation of different developmental
stages or generations to deviating
conditions of life, we thus not only explain
the exact and often striking agreement between
form and mode of life&mdash;we not only bridge over
the gap between metamorphosis and alternation
of generation, but we can also understand how,
within one and the same family of Hydrozoa,
species can occur with or without alternation of
generation, and further how other species can
exist in which the alternation of generation (the
production of free Medusæ) is limited to the one
sex; we can understand in general how one continuous
series of forms may lead from the simple
sexual organ of the Polypes to the independent
and free swimming sexual form of the Medusæ,
and how hand in hand with this the simple reproduction
becomes gradually cyclical. It is just
these intermediate steps between the two kinds of
reproduction that make quite untenable the idea
that the heterogeneous forms in cyclical propagation
arise through so-called “heterogeneous
generation,” <i>i.e.</i> through sudden <i>per saltum</i>
transformation. It is excusable if philosophers
to whom these facts are strange, or who have to
take the trouble of working them up, should
adduce alternation of generation as an instance
of “heterogeneous generation,” but by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">701</a></span>
naturalists this should be once and for ever
abandoned.</p>

<p>All other facts which have hitherto been
referred to “heterogeneous generation” are still
less explicable as such, inasmuch as they always
relate to changes in single parts of an organism,
such as the sudden change of fruit or flower in
cultivated plants. The notion of <i>per saltum</i> development,
however, demands a total transformation&mdash;it
comprises (as Von Hartmann quite
correctly and logically admits) the idea of a <i>fixed
specific type</i> which can only be re-modelled <i>as a
whole</i>, and cannot become modified piecemeal.
It must further be added, that the observed
variations which have arisen abruptly in single
parts are not as a rule <span class="locked">inherited:<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a></span> fruit-trees are
only propagated by grafting, <i>i.e.</i> by perpetuating
the individual, and not by ordinary reproduction
by seeds. Now, if we nowhere see sudden variations
of large amount perpetuated by heredity,
whilst we everywhere observe small variations
which can all be inherited, must it not be concluded
that <i>per saltum</i> modification is not the
means which Nature employs in transforming
species, but that an accumulation of small variations
takes place, these leading in time to large
differences? Is it logical to reject the latter conclusion
because our period of observation is too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">702</a></span>
brief to enable us to directly follow long series of
accumulations, whilst <i>per saltum</i> variation is admitted,
although unsupported by a single observation?
As long as there remains any prospect
of tracing large deviations to the continually
observed phenomenon of small variations, I believe
we have no right to resort to the purely hypothetical
explanation afforded by <i>per saltum</i> variations.</p>

<p>But the hypothesis of “heterogeneous generation”
is not only without a basis of facts&mdash;it can
also be directly shown to be untenable. Since
the operation of an internal power of transformation
does not explain adaptation to the conditions
of life, the claims of natural selection to explain
these transformations must be admitted; but the
co-operation of a phyletic vital force and natural
selection is inconceivable if we imagine the modifications
to occur <i>per saltum</i>.</p>

<p>The supposed “heterogeneous generation” is
always illustrated by the example of alternation of
generation. The origination of a new animal
form is thus conceived to take place in the same
manner as we now see, in the cyclical reproduction
of the Medusæ, free swimming, bell-shaped
Medusoids, produced from fixed polypites, or
<i>Cercariæ</i> from Trematode worms by internal
budding; in brief, it is imagined that one animal
form suddenly gives rise to another widely deviating
form by purely internal causes. Now on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703">703</a></span>
this theory it would be an unavoidable postulate,
that by such a process of <i>per saltum</i> development
there arises not merely a new type of some
species, but at the same time individuals capable
of living and of persisting under, and fitted to,
given conditions of life. But every naturalist who
has attempted to completely explain the relation
between structure and mode of life knows that
even the small differences which separate one
species from another, always comprise a number
of minute structural deviations which are related
to well defined conditions of life&mdash;he knows that
in every species of animal the whole structure is
adapted in the most exact manner <i>in every detail</i>
to special conditions of life. It is not an exaggeration
when I say in every detail, since the
so-called “purely morphological parts” could not
be other than they are without causing changes in
other parts which exercise a definite function. I
will not indeed assert that in the most closely
related species all the parts of the body must in
some manner differ from one another, if only to a
small extent; it seems to me not improbable,
however, that an exact comparison would very
frequently give this result. That animals which
are so widely removed in their morphological
relations as Medusæ and Polypes, or Trematoda
and their “nurses,” are differently constructed
in each of their parts can, however, be stated
with certainty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">704</a></span></p>

<p>Now if this wide deviation in every part were in
itself no obstacle to the assumption of a designing
and re-modelling power, it would become so by
the circumstance that all the parts of the organism
must stand in the most precise relation to the
external conditions of life, if the organism is to be
capable of existing&mdash;all the parts must be exactly
adapted to certain conditions of life. How can
this be brought about by a transforming force
acting spasmodically? Von Hartmann&mdash;who, in
spite of his clear perception and widely extended
scientific knowledge, cannot possibly possess a
strong conviction of that harmony between structure
and life-conditions prevailing throughout the whole
system of the organism, and which personal research
and contemplation are alone able to give&mdash;simply
bridges over the difficulty by permitting
natural selection to come to his aid as an
“auxiliary principle” of the re-modelling power.
It would not be supposed that naturalists would
resort to the same device&mdash;nevertheless those who
support the phyletic force and <i>per saltum</i> development
generally invoke natural selection as
the principle which governs adaptation. But
when does this agency come into operation?
When by germinal metamorphosis a new form
has arisen, this, from the first moment of its existence,
must be adapted to the new conditions of
life or it must perish. No time is allowed for it
to continue in an unadapted state throughout a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">705</a></span>
series of generations until adaptation is luckily
reached through natural selection. Let us have
either natural selection or a phyletic force&mdash;both
together are inconceivable. If there exists
a phyletic force, then it must itself bring about
adaptation.</p>

<p>It might perhaps be here suggested that the
same objection applies to that process of modification
which is effected by small steps, but that
it does so only when the change occurs suddenly.
This, however, as I have already attempted to
show, but very rarely takes place; in many cases
(mimicry) the conditions even change in the first
place through the change in form and therefore,
as is evident, as gradually as the latter. It must
be the same in all other cases where transformation
of the existing form and not merely extinction
of the species concerned takes place. The
transmutation must always keep pace with the
change in the conditions of life, since if the latter
change more rapidly the species could not
compete with rival species&mdash;it would become
extinct.</p>

<p>The abrupt transformation of species implies
sudden change in the conditions of life, since a
Medusa does not live like a Polype, nor a Trematode
like its “nurse.” For this reason it is impossible
that natural selection can be an aiding
principle of “heterogeneous generation.” If such
abrupt transformation takes place it must produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">706</a></span>
the new form instantly equipped for the struggle
for existence, and adapted in all its organs and
systems of organs to the special conditions of its
new life. But would not this be “pure magic”?
It is not thereby even taken into consideration
that here&mdash;as in the cases of mimicry&mdash;time and
place must agree. The requirements of a pre-established
harmony (“<i>prästabilirte Harmonie</i>”)
further demand that an animal fitted for special
conditions of life should only make its appearance
at that precise period of the earth’s history when
these special conditions are all fulfilled, and so
forth.</p>

<p>But he who has learnt to perceive the numerous
and fine relations which, in every species of
animal, bring the details of structure into harmony
with function, and who keeps in view the impelling
power of these conditions, cannot possibly hold
to the idea of a <i>per saltum</i> development of
animal forms. If development has taken place, it
must have occurred gradually and by minute steps&mdash;in
such a manner indeed that each modification
had time to become equilibrated to the other
parts, and in this way a succession of modifications
gradually brought about the total transformation
of the organism, and at the same time
secured complete adaptation to new conditions
of life.</p>

<p>Not only abrupt modification however, but
every transformation is to be rejected when based<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">707</a></span>
upon the interference of a metaphysical principle
of development. Those to whom the arguments
already advanced against such a principle appear
insufficient may once more be asked, how and
where should this principle properly interfere? I
am of opinion that one effect can have but
one sufficient cause; if this suffices to produce it,
no second cause is required. The hand of a
watch necessarily turns once round in a circle in a
given time as soon as the spring which sets the
mechanism in movement is wound up; in an unwound
watch a skilful finger can perhaps give the
same movement to the hand, but it is impossible
that the latter can receive both from the operator
and from the spring at <i>the same time, the same
motion</i> as that which it would receive through
either of these two powers <i>alone</i>. In the same
manner it appears to me that the variations which
lead to transformation cannot be at the same
time determined by physical and by metaphysical
causes, but must depend upon either one or the
other.</p>

<p>On no side will it be disputed that at least one
portion of the processes of organic life depends
upon the mechanical co-operation of physical
forces. How is it conceivable that sudden pauses
should occur in the course of these causal forces,
and that a directive power should be substituted
therefor, the latter subsequently making way
again for the physical forces? To me this is as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708">708</a></span>
inconceivable as the idea that lightning is the
electric discharge of a thunder-cloud, of which the
formation and electrical tension depends upon
causal forces, and of which the time and place are
purely determined by such forces, but that Jupiter
has it nevertheless in his power to direct the
lightning flash according to his will on to the
head of the guilty.</p>

<p>Now although I deny the possibility or conceivability
of the contemporaneous co-operation
of teleological and of causal forces in producing
any effect, and although I maintain that a purely
mechanical conception of the processes of nature
is alone justifiable, I nevertheless believe that
there is no occasion for this reason to renounce
the existence of, or to disown, a directive power;
only we must not imagine this to interfere directly
in the mechanism of the universe, but to be rather
behind the latter as the final cause of this
mechanism.</p>

<p>Von Baer himself points this out to us, although
he does not follow up the complete consequences
of his arguments. He especially insists in his
book, which abounds in beautiful and grand ideas,
that the notions of necessity (causality) and of
purpose by no means necessarily exclude one
another, but rather that they can be connected
together in a certain manner. Thus, the watchmaker
attains his end, the watch, by combining
the elastic force of a spring with wheel-work, <i>i.e.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">709</a></span>
by utilizing physical necessities; the farmer
accomplishes his purpose, that of obtaining a
crop of corn, by sowing the seed in suitable land,
but the seed must germinate as an absolute
necessity when exposed to the influences of
warmth, soil, moisture, &amp;c. Thus, in these instances
a chain of necessities is undoubtedly
connected with a teleological force, the human
will; and it directly follows from such cases that
wherever we see an aim or result attained through
necessities, the directive force does not interrupt
the course of the series of necessities which have
already commenced, but is active before the first
commencement of these necessities, since it combines
and sets the latter in movement. From the
moment when the mechanism of the watch is
combined harmoniously and the spring wound up,
it goes without the further interference of the
watchmaker, just as the corn-seed when once
placed in the earth develops into a plant without
assistance from the farmer.</p>

<p>If we apply this argument to the development
of the organic world, those who defend mechanical
development will not be compelled to deny a
teleological power, only they would have with
<span class="locked">Kant<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a></span> to think of the latter in the only way in
which it can be conceived, viz. <i>as a Final Cause</i>.</p>

<p>In the region of inorganic nature nobody any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">710</a></span>
longer doubts the purely mechanical connection
of the phenomena. Sunshine and rain do not
now appear to us to be whims of a deity, but
divine natural laws. As the knowledge of the
processes of nature advances, the point where the
divine power designedly interrupts these processes
must be removed further back; or, as the author
of the criticism of the philosophy of the <span class="locked">Unconscious<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a></span>
expresses it, all advance in the knowledge
of natural processes depends “upon the
continual elimination of the idea of the miraculous.”
We now believe that organic nature must
be conceived as mechanical. But does it thereby
follow that we must totally deny a final Universal
Cause? Certainly not; it would be a great
delusion if any one were to believe that he had
arrived at a comprehension of the universe by
tracing the phenomena of nature to mechanical
principles. He would thereby forget that the
assumption of eternal matter with its eternal laws
by no means satisfies our intellectual need for
causality. We require before everything an explanation
of the fact that relationships everywhere
exist between the parts of the universe&mdash;that
atoms everywhere act upon one <span class="locked">another.<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a></span> He
who can content himself with the assumption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">711</a></span>
of matter may do so, but he will not be able
to show that the assumption of a Universal Cause
underlying the laws of nature is erroneous.</p>

<p>It will not be said that there is no advantage in
assuming such a Final Cause, because we cannot
conceive it, and indeed cannot so much as demonstrate
it with certainty. It certainly lies beyond
our power of conception, in the obscure region of
metaphysics, and all attempts to approach it have
never led to anything but an image or a formula.
Nevertheless there is an advance in knowledge in
the assumption of this Cause which well admits of
comparison with those advances which have been
led to by certain results of the new physiology of
the senses. We now know that the images which
give us our sense of the external world are not
“actual representations having any degree of
<span class="locked">resemblance,”<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a></span> but are only signs for certain qualities
of the outer world, which do not exist as such
in the latter, but belong entirely to our consciousness.
Thus we know for certain that the world
is not as we perceive it&mdash;that we cannot perceive
“things in their essence”&mdash;and that the reality will
always remain transcendental to us. But who
will deny that in this knowledge there is a considerable
advance, in spite of its being for the most
part of a negative character? But just as we
must assume behind the phenomenal world of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712">712</a></span>
senses an actual world of the true nature of which
we receive only an incomplete knowledge (<i>i.e.</i> a
knowledge corresponding only in reality with the
relations of time and space), so behind the co-operating
forces of nature which “aim at a purpose”
must we admit a Cause, which is no less
inconceivable in its nature, and of which we can
only say one thing with certainty, viz., that it must
be teleological. Just as the former first leads
us to perceive the true value of our sensual impressions,
so does the latter knowledge lead us to
foresee the true significance of the mechanism of
the universe.</p>

<p>It is true that in neither case do we learn more
than that there is something present which we do
not perceive, but in both instances this knowledge
is of the greatest value. The consciousness that
behind that mechanism of the universe which is
alone comprehensible to us there still lies an
incomprehensible teleological Universal Cause, necessitates
quite a different conception of the universe&mdash;a
conception absolutely opposed to that of
the materialist. Most correctly and beautifully
does Von Baer say that “a purpose cannot be
otherwise conceived by us than as proceeding
from a will and consciousness; in this would the
‘aiming at a purpose,’ which appears to us as
reasonable as it is necessary, have its deepest
root.” If we conceive in this world a divine Universal
Power exercising volition as the ultimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713">713</a></span>
basis of matter and of the natural laws resident
therein, we thus reconcile the apparent contradiction
between the mechanical conception and teleology.
In the same way that Von Hartmann,
somewhere speaks of the immanent teleology of a
machine, we might speak of the immanent teleology
of the universe, because the single forces of
matter are so exactly adjusted that they must give
rise to the projected world, just as the wheels and
levers of a machine bring forth a required manufactured
article. I admit that these are grossly
anthropomorphic ideas. But as mortals can we
have any other ideas? Is not the notion of purpose
in itself an equally anthropomorphic one? and is
there any certainty that the idea of causality is
less so? Do we know that causality is unlimited,
or that it is universally valid? In the absence of
this knowledge, should it not be permissible to
satisfy as far as we can the craving of the human
mind for a spiritual First Cause of the universe, by
speaking of it in terms conceivable to human
understanding? We can take up such a final
position and still be conscious that we thereby
form no certain conception, and indeed come no
nearer to the reality. The materialist still makes
use of the notion of “eternity,” and frequently
handles it as though it were a perfectly known
quantity. We nevertheless do not seriously believe
that by the expression “eternal matter,” any true
idea resulting from human experience is gained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">714</a></span></p>

<p>If it is asked, however, how that which in
ourselves and in the remainder of the animal
world is <i>intellectual</i> and <i>perceptive</i>, which <i>thinks</i>
and <i>wills</i>, is ascribable to a mechanical process of
organic development&mdash;whether the development
of the mind can be conceived as resulting from
purely mechanical laws? I answer unhesitatingly
in the affirmative with the pure materialist, although
I do not agree with him as to the manner in which
he derives these phenomena from matter, since
thinking and extension are heterogeneous things,
and one cannot be considered as a product of the
other. But why should not the ancient notion of
“conscious matter” given out by Maupertuis and
Robinet, not be again entertained, as pointed out
in recent times by Fechner?<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> Would there not
thus be found a useful formula for explaining
phenomena hitherto quite incomprehensible?</p>

<p>Von Hartmann in criticizing himself, designates
the sensibility of atoms as an “almost inevitable
hypothesis” (p. 62), “inevitable because if sensibility
were not a general and original property of
the constituent elements of matter, it would be
absolutely incomprehensible how through its
potentiality and integration that sensibility known
to us as being possessed by the organism could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">715</a></span>
have arisen.” “It is impossible that from purely
external elements devoid of all internality (<i>Innerlichkeit</i>)
there should suddenly appear, by a
certain mode of combination, an internality which
becomes more and more richly developed. The
more certainly science becomes convinced that in
the sphere of externality (<i>Äusserlichkeit</i>) the higher
(organic) phenomena are only results of combination,
or are the aggregate phenomena of the
elementary atomic forces, the more surely, when
she once seriously concerns herself with this other
question, will she not fail to be convinced that the
sensibility possessed by higher stages of consciousness
can be only combination-results, or the
aggregate phenomena of the elementary sensations
of atoms, although these atomic sensations as
such always remain below the level of the higher
combinations of consciousness.” In confusing
this double-sided nature of the objective phenomenon
“lies the main error of all materialism and
of all subjective idealism. Just as the attempt of
the latter (subjective idealism) to construct the
external phenomena of existence in space out of
functions of internality and their combinations is
impossible, so is the endeavour of the former
(materialism) to build up internal sensation out of
any combinations of force acting externally in
space equally impossible.”</p>

<p>I have no intention of going any deeper into
these questions. I mention them only in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">716</a></span>
point out that even from this side there appears to
me no obstacle in the way of a purely mechanical
conception of the processes of the universe. The
naturalist may be excused if he attempts to penetrate
into the region of philosophy; it arises from
the wish to be able to contribute a little towards
the reconciliation of the latest knowledge of the
naturalist with the religious wants of the human mind&mdash;towards
the aim striven for by both sides, viz. a
satisfactory and harmonious view of the universe,
according with the state of knowledge of our time.</p>

<p>I believe that I have shown that the theory
of selection by no means leads&mdash;as is always
assumed&mdash;to the denial of a teleological Universal
Cause and to materialism, and I thereby hope
that I have cleared the way for this doctrine, the
importance of which it is scarcely possible to over-estimate.
Many, and not the most ill-informed,
do not get so far as to make an unbiassed examination
into the facts, because they are at the outset
alarmed by the to them inevitable consequence of
the materialistic conception of the universe. Mechanism
and teleology do not exclude one another,
they are rather in mutual agreement. Without
teleology there would be no mechanism, but only
a confusion of crude forces; and without mechanism
there would be no teleology, for how could the
latter otherwise effect its purpose?<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a></p>

<p>Von Hartmann correctly says:&mdash;“The most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717">717</a></span>
complete mechanism conceivable is likewise the
most completely conceivable teleology.” We
may thus represent the phenomenal universe
as such a completely conceivable mechanism.
With this conception vanish all apprehensions
that the new views would cause man to lose
the best that he possesses&mdash;morality and purely
human spiritual culture. He who, with Von
Baer, considers the laws of nature as the “permanent
expressions of the will of a creative principle,”
will clearly perceive that a further advance
in the knowledge of these laws need not divert
man from the path of increasing improvement, but
must further him in this course&mdash;that the knowledge
of truth, whatever may be its purport, cannot
possibly be considered a backward step. Let us
take our stand boldly on the ground of new
knowledge, and accept the direct consequences
thereof, and we shall not be obliged to give up
either morality or the comforting conviction of
being part of an harmonious world, as a necessary
member capable of development and perfection.</p>

<p>Any other mode of interference by a directive
teleological power in the processes of the universe
than by the appointment of the forces producing
them, is however, at least to the naturalist, inadmissible.
We are still far removed from completely
understanding the mechanism by means of
which the organic world is evoked&mdash;we still find
ourselves at the very beginning of knowledge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_718" id="Page_718">718</a></span>
We are, however, already convinced that both the
organic and the inorganic worlds are dependent
only upon mechanical forces, for to this conclusion
we are led, not only by the results of investigators
who have restricted themselves to limited provinces,
but also by the most general considerations.
But although the force of these arguments may
not be acknowledged, and although one might
maintain that the inductional proofs against the
existence of a “phyletic vital force” have been
directed only against points of detail, or have
never been completely demonstrated, <i>i.e.</i> for all
points, it must nevertheless be conceded, that for
the naturalist the mechanical conception of Nature
is the only one possible&mdash;that he is not at all
justified in abandoning this view so long as the
interference of teleological forces <i>in the course</i> of
the processes of organic development has not
been demonstrated to him. Thus, it will not be
immaterial whether a conception of Nature which
to many seems inevitable is consistent with the
idea of universal design, or a final directive universal
principle, since the value which we may
attach to our own lives and aims, essentially
depends thereon. The final and main result of
this essay will thus be found in the attempted
demonstration that the mechanical conception of
Nature very well admits of being united with a
teleological conception of the Universe.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a name="Footnote_17" id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> [Eng. ed. In the German edition, which appeared in
1874, I was not able to support this hypothesis by geographical
data, and could then only ask the question “whether
in the most northern portion of its area of distribution,
appears in two or only in one generation?” This question is
now answered by the Swedish Expedition to the Yenisei in
1876. Herr Philipp Trybom, one of the members of this
expedition, observed <i>A. Levana</i> at the end of June and
beginning of July, in the middle of Yenisei, in 60°-63° N.
(Dagfjärilar från Yenisei in Översigt ap k. Vertensk. Akad.
Förhandlingon, 1877, No. 6.) Trybom found <i>Levana</i> at
Yenisk on June 23rd, at Worogova (61° 5´) on July 3rd, at
Asinova (61° 25´) on July 4th, at Insarowa (62° 5´) on July
7th, and at Alinskaja (63° 25´) on July 9th. The butterflies
were especially abundant at the beginning of June, and were
all of the typical <i>Levana</i> form. Trybom expressly states, “we
did not find a single specimen which differed perceptibly from
Weismann’s <a href="#Plate_I">Figs. 1 and 2</a> (‘Saison-Dimorphismus’ Taf. I.).”
</p>
<p>
The Swedish expedition soon left the Yenisei, and consequently
was not able to decide by observations whether
a second generation possessing the <i>Prorsa</i> form appeared
later in the summer. Nevertheless, it may be stated with
great probability that this is not the case. The districts in
which <i>Levana</i> occurs on the Yenisei have about the same
isotherm as Archangel or Haparanda, and therefore the same
summer temperature. Dr. Staudinger, whose views I solicited,
writes to me:&mdash;“In Finnmark (about 67° N.) I observed no
species with two generations; even <i>Polyommatus Phlæas</i>, which
occurs there, and which in Germany has always two, and in
the south, perhaps, three generations, in Finnmark has only one
generation. A second generation would be impossible, and
this would also be the case with <i>Levana</i> in the middle of
Yenisei. I certainly have <i>Levana</i> and <i>Prorsa</i> from the middle
of Amur, but <i>Levana</i> flies there at the end of May, and the
summers are very warm.” The middle of Amur lies, moreover,
in 50° N. lat., and therefore 10°-13° south of the
districts of the Yenisei mentioned.
</p>
<p>
It must thus be certainly admitted that on the Yenisei <i>A.
Levana</i> occurs only in the <i>Levana</i> form, and that consequently
this species is at the present time, in the northernmost portion
of its area of distribution, in the same condition as that in
which I conceive it to have been in mid Europe during the
glacial period. It would be of the greatest interest to make
experiments in breeding with this single-brooded <i>Levana</i> from
the Yenisei, i.e., to attempt to change its offspring into the
<i>Prorsa</i> form by the action of a high temperature. If this
could not be accomplished it would furnish a confirmation of
my hypothesis than which nothing more rigorous could be
desired.]</p></div>

colours of the <i>Daphniidæ</i>; and, as a result, I no longer
doubt that sexual selection plays a very important part in the
marking and colouring of butterflies. I by no means exclude
both transforming factors, however; it is quite conceivable, on
the contrary, that a change produced directly by climate may
be still further increased by sexual selection. The above given
case of <i>Polyommatus Phlæas</i> may perhaps be explained in this
manner. That sexual selection plays a part in butterflies, is
proved above all by the odoriferous scales and tufts of the males
discovered by Fritz Müller.] [For remarks on the odours
emitted by butterflies and moths, see Fritz Müller in “Jena.

organs of the female <i>Heliconinæ</i> are fully described in a paper
in “Zeit. f. Wissen. Zool.,” vol. xxx. p. 167. The position of
the scent-tufts in the sphinx-moths is shown in Proc. Entom. Soc.
1878, p. ii. Many British moths, such as <i>Phlogophora meticulosa</i>,
<i>Cosmia trapezina</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c., have tufts in a similar position.
The fans on the feet of <i>Acidalia bisetata</i>, <i>Herminia barbalis</i>,

moth from Jamaica, well known to possess a powerful odour
when alive (<i>Erebus odorus</i> Linn.), has great scent-tufts on the

fate of the species depended on the last larval brood of the

it might well happen that now and then an early frost or
a tempestuous season would destroy all the larvæ of the

this work, numerous descriptions of the young stages of caterpillars
have been given, but in all cases without representing
the relationship of the forms.] [In the excellent figures of
larvæ at various stages of growth, given in some of the more
recent works on Lepidoptera, there will be found much material
which may be regarded as a contribution to the field of research
entered on by the author in the present essay, <i>i.e.</i> the ontogeny
and comparative morphology of larval markings, although it is
much to be regretted that the figures and descriptions have not
been given from this point of view. In his “Butterflies of
North America,” for example, W. H. Edwards figures the
young as well as the adult larvæ of species of <i>Apatura</i>, <i>Argynnis</i>,
<i>Libythea</i>, <i>Phyciodes</i>, <i>Limenitis</i>, <i>Colias</i>, <i>Papilio</i>, &amp;c.
Burmeister, in his recently published “Lépidoptères de la
République Argentine,” figures the young stages of species of
<i>Caligo</i>, <i>Opsiphanes</i>, <i>Callidryas</i>, <i>Philampelus</i>, &amp;c. Messrs.
Hellins and Buckler have figured and described the early stages
of large numbers of the caterpillars of British Lepidoptera, but
their figures remain unpublished. The larvæ of many of our
native species belonging to the genera <i>Liparis</i>, <i>Tæniocampa</i>,
<i>Epunda</i>, <i>Cymatophora</i>, <i>Calocampa</i>, &amp;c., are dull when young,
but become brightly coloured at the last moult. Such changes
of colour are probably associated with some change, either in
the habits or in the environment; and a careful study of the
ontogenetic development of such species in connection with
their life-history would furnish results of great value to the
present inquiry. The same remarks apply to those <i>Noctuæ</i>
larvæ which are brightly coloured in their young stages, and
become dull when adult.

Among other papers which may be considered as contributions
to the present subject, I may mention the following:&mdash;In
1864 Capt. Hutton published a paper, “On the Reversion
and Restoration of the Silkworm, Part II.” (Trans. Ent. Soc.
1864, p. 295), in which he describes the various stages of
development of several species of <i>Bombycidæ</i>. In 1867
G. Semper published accounts of the early stages of several
Sphinx-larvæ (“Beiträge zur Entwicklungsgeschichte einiger
ostasiatischer Schmetterlinge,” Verhandl. k.k. Zoolog.-botan.
Gesell. in Wien, vol. xvii.). The question as to the number
of claspers in young <i>Noctuæ</i> larvæ has been raised in notes
by Dr. F. Buchanan White (“Ent. Mo. Mag.,” vol. v. p. 204) and
B. Lockyer (“Entomologist,” 1871, p. 433). A valuable paper,
“On the Embryonic Larvæ of Butterflies,” was published in
1871 by S. H. Scudder (“Ent. Mo. Mag.,” vol. viii. p. 122). For
remarks on the development of the larva of <i>Papilio Merope</i>,
see J. P. Mansel Weale in Trans. Ent. Soc., 1874, p. 131, and
Pl. I.; also this author on the young stages of the larva
of <i>Gynanisa Isis</i>, Trans. Ent. Soc., 1878, p. 184. For an
account of the development of the larvæ of certain North
American species of <i>Satyrus</i>, see W. H. Edwards in the
“Canadian Entom.,” vol. xii. p. 21. Mr. P. H. Gosse’s recent
description of the newly hatched caterpillar of <i>Papilio Homerus</i>
(Proc. Ent. Soc. 1879, p. lv), furnishes a good illustration of
the value of studying the ontogeny. The natural affinities
of the <i>Papilionidæ</i> were at one time much disputed, some
systematists placing this family at the head of the Lepidoptera,
and others regarding them as being more closely allied to the
moths. Mr. Gosse’s observation tends to confirm the latter
view, now generally received by Lepidopterists, since he states
that the larva in question “suggests one of the great <i>Saturniadæ</i>,
such as <i>Samia Cecropia</i>.” Mr. Scudder, in the paper
above referred to, adopts an analogous argument to show
the close relationship between the <i>Papilionidæ</i> and <i>Hesperidæ</i>.

If the author’s views are ultimately accepted, the species at

the <i>Arctiidæ</i>, <i>Liparidæ</i>, <i>Notodontidæ</i>, and <i>Noctuæ</i>. Mr. Butler’s
determination of the affinities of the species supposed to belong
to the genus mentioned, is based chiefly upon a comparative
examination of the larvæ, and this is far more likely to show
the true blood-relationship of the species than a comparison
of the perfect insects only. A study of the comparative
ontogeny can alone give a final answer to this question. R.M.]</p></div>

the other green. The former has two distinct ocelli on the
fourth and fifth segments, and a distinct rudiment on the sixth,
whilst the subdorsal line extends from the second eye-spot to
the caudal horn, and beneath this line the oblique lateral
stripes stand out conspicuously in dark brown on a lighter
ground. The ocelli are equally well developed on the fourth
and fifth segments in the green variety, the subdorsal line
commencing on the sixth segment, and extending to the caudal
horn; there is no trace of a third eye-spot, nor are there any
oblique lateral stripes; the insect is almost the exact counterpart
of <i>C. Elpenor</i> in its fourth stage. (See Fig. 21, <a href="#Plate_IV">Pl. IV</a>.)
<i>Pergesa Mongoliana</i>, Butl., is brown, without a trace of the
subdorsal line except on the three front segments, and with
only one large eye-spot on the fourth segment. <i>Chærocampa
Lewisii</i>, Butl., from Japan, is likewise figured in two forms.
The brown variety has the subdorsal line on the three front
segments only, distinct ocelli on the fourth and fifth segments,
and gradually diminishing rudiments on the remaining segments.
The green form appears to be transitional between
the present and the third group, as it possesses a distinct, but
rudimentary eye-spot on the third segment, besides the fully
developed ones on the fourth and fifth, and very conspicuous,
but gradually decreasing repetitions of rudimentary ocelli on
segments 6&ndash;10. To this group may be added <i>Chærocampa
Aristor</i>, Boisd., the caterpillar of which is figured by Burmeister
(Lép. Rép. Arg., Pl. XV., Fig. 4) in the characteristic attitude
of alarm, with the front segments retracted, and the ocelli on
the fourth segment prominently exposed. The subdorsal line
is present in this species. Burmeister also figures two of the
early stages (Pl. XV., Fig. 7, A and B), and describes the complete
development of <i>Philampelus Labruscæ</i>, another species
belonging to the subfamily <i>Chærocampinæ</i>. The earliest stage
(3&ndash;4 days old) is simple green, with no trace of any marking
except a black spot on each side of the fourth segment, the
position of the future ocelli. A curved horn is present both in
this stage and the following one, during which the caterpillar
is still green, but now has seven oblique red lateral stripes. The
caudal horn is shed at the second moult, after which the colour
becomes darker, the adult larva (figured by Madame Mérian,
in her work on Surinam, pl. 34 and Sepp., pl. 32) being
mottled brown. In addition to the ocellus on the fourth segment,
there is another slightly larger on the eleventh segment,
so that this species may perhaps be another transition to the
third group; but our knowledge is still too imperfect to
attempt to generalize with safety. R.M.]</p></div>

caterpillars of this species in the neighbourhood of Twickenham,
ten to twelve of which were feeding on <i>Salix viminalis</i>, and
the remainder, from a locality not far distant, on <i>Salix triandra</i>.
The whole of the specimens taken on the plant first named,
had the red-brown spots above and below the oblique stripes
more or less completely developed, as I myself had an opportunity
of observing. In these spotted specimens the ground-colour
was bright yellowish-green, and in the others this
colour was dull whitish-green above, passing into bluish-green
below. Should these observations receive wider confirmation,
it would be fair to conclude that this species is now in two
states of phyletic development, the more advanced stage being
represented by the brighter spotted variety. (See also Proc.
Ent. Soc. 1879, p. xliv.). Mr. Peter Cameron has recently
suggested (Trans. Ent. Soc. 1880, p. 69) that the reddish-brown
spots on the <i>Smerinthus</i> caterpillars may serve for purposes
of disguise, as they closely resemble, both in colour

considered as a new character, now being developed by
natural selection. The variation in the ground-colour of the

been made known through Mr. Butler’s figures. <i>Smerinthus
Tatarinovii</i>, Ménetriés (<i>loc. cit.</i> Pl. XC., Fig. 16), from Japan,
is “pale sea-green, tuberculated with white, with seven lateral,
oblique, crimson-edged white stripes.” There is no trace of
the subdorsal line shown in the figure, so that this species
thus appears to be in the third phyletic stage of development.
<i>Smerinthus Planus</i>, Walker, from China (<i>loc. cit.</i> Pl XCII.,
Fig. 11), is “pale green, with white or yellow lateral stripes.”
A trace of the subdorsal line remains on the front segments,
thus showing that the species is in the second phyletic stage
of development. <i>Triptogon Roseipennis</i>, Butler, from Hakodadi
(<i>loc. cit.</i> Pl. XCI., Fig. 6), is represented as yellow, with seven
oblique white stripes, with large irregular triangular red spots
extending from the anterior edge of the stripes, nearly across
each segment. It is probably in the third phyletic stage.
The Indian <i>Polyptychus Dentatus</i>, Cramer (<i>loc. cit.</i> Pl. XCI.,
Fig. 10), is “bluish-green at the sides, with oblique purple
stripes, with a broad, dorsal, longitudinal, golden-green band,
bordered by subtriangular purple spots, one above each stripe.”
The dorsal band is bordered by coloured stripes, which may be
the subdorsal lines; but the position in which it is figured, and
its very different mode of coloration, make it very difficult to
compare satisfactorily with the foregoing species. The genus
<i>Ambulyx</i> is closely allied to the <i>Smerinthinæ</i>, and the two
following species may be here mentioned: <i>A. Gannascus</i>,
Stoll, figured by Burmeister (<i>loc. cit.</i> Pl. XIII., Fig. 5), is
green, with a yellow subdorsal line, and seven oblique white
lateral stripes, edged with red. <i>A. Liturata</i>, Butl. (<i>loc. cit.</i>
Pl. XCI., Fig. 2), is yellowish-green above, passing into
bluish-green below. The subdorsal is present on the three
front segments, and is followed by a row of white, elongated
patches, one on each segment, these being the upper portions
of a row of lateral oblique stripes. The thickened upper
extremities of the latter are edged with red, and their arrangement
is very suggestive of their having arisen from the breaking
up of a subdorsal line. R.M.]</p></div>

displayed by certain butterflies has originated through polymorphism
from ordinary variability. I will not here enter into
details, but will only cite a few instances indicating the general
direction of the arguments. The phenomenon to which I
refer is that so ably treated of by Mr. A. R. Wallace (see Part I.,
p. <a href="#Page_32">32</a>, note <a href="#Footnote_20">20</a>) and others. One male has often two or more
distinctly coloured females, and in such cases one form of the
female generally resembles the male in colour. Cases of
polymorphic <i>mimetic</i> females may for the present be excluded,
in order to reduce the argument to its greatest simplicity. Thus,
in the case of native species, <i>Colias Edusa</i> has two females, one
having the orange ground-colour of the male, and the other
the well-known light form, var. <i>Helice</i>. So, also, <i>Argynnis
Paphia</i> has a normal female and the dark melanic form
var. <i>Valezina</i>. Numerous other cases might be mentioned
among exotic species; and, looking at the phenomenon as a
whole, it is seen to be one of <i>gradation</i>. For instance, our
common “Blues” (<i>Plebeius Icarus</i>, <i>P. Thetis</i>, &amp;c.) have females
showing a complete gradation between the ordinary blue male and
the brown female coloration. In a large number of specimens of
<i>Callosune Eupompe</i> in my cabinet, collected in Arabia by the late
J. K. Lord, there is a completely graduated series of females, varying
from individuals having the scarlet tips of the fore-wings as
strongly developed as in the males, to specimens without a trace
of such colouring; and the same is the case with other species of
this and allied genera. In such instances it is only necessary
for the intermediate female forms to become extinct, in order to
have true cases of dimorphism. It is significant that in 1877,
when <i>Colias Edusa</i> appeared in this country in such extraordinary
profusion, large numbers of <i>intermediate forms</i> were
captured, these forming an uninterrupted series connecting
the normal female and the var. <i>Helice</i>. R.M.]</p></div>

<i>A. Medusa</i>, Butl., from nearly the same localities as the last
(Pl. XCII., Fig. 10). Most of these species fall under Dr.
Weismann’s general remarks, so that it is unnecessary to give
detailed descriptions. The most divergent marking is that of
<i>P. Cyrtolophia</i>, which has a broad white dorsal line bordered
with pink, and two large pink ovals on the back of the four
anterior segments, the hindmost and larger of these being
bisected by the dorsal line. In <i>N. Hespera</i> the subdorsal line is
present on segments 6 to 11 only, and it is highly significant
that the oblique stripes are absent from these segments, but
are present on the anterior segments, where the subdorsal line
fails. With reference to the larva of <i>A. Atropos</i>, Mr. Mansel
Weale states (Proc. Ent. Soc. 1878, p. v.) that in S. Africa the
ordinary form feeds generally on <i>Solanaceæ</i>, whilst the darker
and rarer variety is found only on species of <i>Lantana</i>. The
following species of these subfamilies are figured by Burmeister:
<i>Amphonyx Jatrophæ</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i> Pl. XI., Fig. 1); <i>Protoparce (Diludia)

All these species have the characteristic Sphinx-like markings.
<i>Dilophonota Ello</i>, Linn. (Pl. XII., Fig. 2), is greenish-brown with
a yellow subdorsal line, and <i>D. Hippothöon</i> (Fig. 4), yellow with
a whitish subdorsal. Neither of these has oblique stripes.
<i>D. Œnotrus</i>, Cram. (Fig. 3), has neither stripes nor subdorsal,

Weale states, with reference to S. African <i>Sphingidæ</i> (Proc.

a habit of doubling up the body, and then jumping a considerable
distance with a spring-like action. This is especially the
case with species having eye-like markings; and it is probable
that if attacked by birds in a hesitating manner, such species
might effect their escape amid the grass or foliage.” Many of
the defensive weapons and habits of larvæ are doubtless means
of protection from ichneumons and other parasitic foes. In
the case of saw-flies, Mr. Peter Cameron has shown (Trans.
Ent. Soc. 1878, p. 196) that the lashing about of the posterior
part of the body may actually frighten away such enemies.
The grotesque attitude and spider-like appearance and movements
of the caterpillar of <i>Stauropus Fagi</i> are considered by
Hermann Müller (“Kosmos,” Nov., 1879, p. 123) to be means
of protection from ichneumons. Among the most remarkable
means of defence possessed by larvæ is that of secreting a liquid,
which Mr. W. H. Edwards has shown, in the case of certain
North American <i>Lycænidæ</i> (“Canadian Entomologist.” vol. x.,
1878, pp. 3&ndash;9 and 131&ndash;136), to be attractive to ants, who
regularly attend these caterpillars, in the same manner and for
the same purpose as they do our aphides. The mutual advantage
derived by the ants and larvæ was discovered in the case
of <i>Lycæna Pseudargiolus</i>. Mr. Edwards states that the <i>mature</i>
larva of this species is singularly free from Hymenopterous and
Dipterous parasites:&mdash;“Why this species, and doubtless many
other <i>Lycænæ</i>, are thus favoured will, perhaps, in some degree
appear from a little incident to be related. On 20th June, in
the woods, I saw a mature larva on its food-plant; and on its
back, facing towards the tail of the larva, stood motionless one
of the larger ants.... At less than two inches behind the larva,
on the stem, was a large ichneumon-fly, watching its chance to
thrust its ovipositor into the larva. I bent down the stem, and
held it horizontally before me, without alarming either of the
parties. The fly crawled a little nearer and rested, and again
nearer, the ant making no sign. At length, after several
advances, the fly turned its abdomen under and forward, thrust
out its ovipositor, and strained itself to the utmost to reach
its prey. The sting was just about to touch the extreme end
of the larva, when the ant made a dash at the fly, which flew
away, and so long as I watched&mdash;at least five minutes&mdash;did
not return. The larva had been quiet all this time, its
tubes out of sight, and head buried in a flower-bud, but the
moment the ant rushed and the fly fled, it seemed to become
aware of the danger, and thrashed about the end of its body
repeatedly in great alarm. But the tubes were not protruded,
as I was clearly able to see with my lens. The ant saved the
larva, and it is probable that ichneumons would in no case get
an opportunity to sting so long as such vigilant guards were
about. It strikes me that the larvæ know their protectors,
and are able and willing to reward them. The advantage is
mutual, and the association is friendly always.” Those who
are familiar with Mr. Belt’s description of the standing armies
of ants kept by the “bull’s-horn thorn” (“Naturalist in
Nicaragua,” pp. 218&ndash;222) and by certain <i>Cecropiæ</i> and <i>Melastomæ</i>,

foregoing case. R.M.]</p></div>

the Theory of Natural Selection,” 1st ed., pp. 117&ndash;122; also
Darwin’s “Descent of Man,” 2nd ed., p. 325. Among the
most important recent additions to the subject of the colours,
spines, and odours of caterpillars, I may call attention to a
paper by Fritz Müller (“Kosmos,” Dec., 1877), the following
abstract of which I communicated to the Entomological
Society (Proc. 1878, pp. vi, vii):&mdash;“The larvæ of <i>Dione Juno</i>
and <i>Acræa Thalia</i> live gregariously, and are brown in colour;
they are covered with spines, but, being of dull colours,
their spiny protection (which in the case of <i>D. Juno</i> is very
imperfect) would not preserve them unless they were distinguished
as inedible at the right time, and not after being
seized, in accordance with the principles laid down by
Mr. Wallace. It is suggested that the social habits of the
larvæ which lead then to congregate in large numbers, make
up for their want of colour, since their offensive odour then
gives timely warning to an approaching enemy. The caterpillars
of <i>Colænis Julia</i> and <i>Dione Vanillæ</i> are equally wanting
in bright colours, but are solitary in their habits, and these
species rest on the under side of the leaf when feeding. On
the other hand, the caterpillars of <i>Heliconius Eucrate</i>, <i>Colænis
Dido</i>, and <i>C. Isabella</i>, which are of solitary habits, and which
freely expose themselves, are very gaudily coloured, and therefore
most conspicuous. As examples of nearly allied larvæ,
of which some species are gregarious and others solitary, Fritz
Müller mentions <i>Morpho</i> and <i>Brassolis</i>, which are gregarious;
while <i>Opsiphanes</i> and <i>Caligo</i> are solitary. The larva of <i>Papilio
Pompeius</i> also is gregarious, and those of <i>P. Nephalion</i>, <i>P.
Polydamas</i>, and <i>P. Thoas</i> are solitary.... Fritz Müller
sums up his observations by remarking that those caterpillars
which live alone, and lack the bright colouring as a sign of
offensiveness, must hide themselves; as those of <i>C. Julia</i> and
<i>D. Vanillæ</i>. The spiny covering is much less a protection
against birds than against smaller enemies; and they may, by
the protective habit of living together, diffuse around themselves
an offensive atmosphere, even to man, and thus gradually becoming
shorter (as with <i>D. Juno</i>), the spines of these caterpillars
become useless, and finally are altogether dropped.”
See also Sir John Lubbock’s “Note on the Colours of British
Caterpillars,” Trans. Ent. Soc. 1878, p. 239. Mr. Peter
Cameron finds (Trans. Ent. Soc. 1880, pp. 71 and 75) that
these remarks are also applicable to the larvæ of certain saw-flies.
In 1877 Mr. J. W. Slater published a paper “On the
Food of gaily-coloured Caterpillars” (Trans. Ent. Soc. 1877,
p. 205), in which he suggested that such caterpillars might
derive their distasteful qualities from feeding on plants containing
poisonous or otherwise noxious principles. A much
larger number of observations will be required, however,
before this view can be accepted as of general application.
A beautiful illustration of the theory of warning colours is
given by Belt in his “Naturalist in Nicaragua,” p. 321. All
the frogs found in the woods round St. Domingo are, with one
exception, protectively coloured; they are of nocturnal habits,
and are devoured by snakes and birds. The exception was a
species of bright red and blue colours, which hopped about
by day and made no attempt at concealment. From these
facts Mr. Belt concluded that this species was inedible, and on
trying the experiment with ducks and fowls this was found to
be the case. R.M.]</p></div>

of this essay, the external conditions remain unaltered during
the lifetime of the caterpillar, but change of habit, and in some
cases of colour, occurs when the insect has attained a size
conceivable <i>à priori</i>, and are realized by observation, in which the
environment itself may undergo change during the lifetime of
the individual caterpillar. Thus, in the case of hibernating
species, the colour which is adaptive to the autumnal colours
of the foliage of their food-trees would not assimilate to that
of the newly-opened leaves in the spring. I have already
quoted (Proc. Zoo. Soc. 1873, p. 155) as instances of what may
be called “seasonal adaptation,” the larvæ of <i>Geometra Papilionaria</i>,
<i>Acidalia Degenararia</i>, and <i>Gnophos Obscurata</i>, and many

colour before or after hibernation, the change being always
adaptive to the environment.
</p>

<p>
It has long been known that caterpillars which feed on
flowers or on plants of variously-coloured foliage, in some cases
partake of the colour of their food. See, for instance, Dr. L.
Möller’s memoir, “Die Abhängigkeit der Inseckten von ihrer
Umgebung,” 1867, and B. D. Walsh “On Phytophagic Varieties
and Phytophagic Species,” Proc. Ent. Soc. Philadelph., vol.
iii., p. 403. In 1865 Mr. R. McLachlan published a paper
entitled “Observations on some remarkable varieties of <i>Sterrha
Sacraria</i>, Linn., with general notes on variation in Lepidoptera”
(Trans. Ent. Soc. 1865, p. 453), in which he gave
many illustrations of this phenomenon. The larva of <i>Heliothis
Peltiger</i>, according to Mr. Reading’s description (Newman’s
“British Moths,” p. 438), is another case in point. In
1874 a number of instances were published by Mr. Thomas
G. Gentry in a paper entitled “Remarkable Variations in
Coloration, Ornamentation, &amp;c., of certain Crepuscular and
Nocturnal Lepidopterous Larvæ” (“Canadian Entomologist,”
vol. vi., p. 85. See also W. H. Edwards’ description of the
summer and autumnal larvæ of <i>Lycæna Pseudargiolus</i>; <i>Ibid.</i>,
vol. x., pp. 12, 13).
</p>

<p>
The caterpillars of the <i>Sphingidæ</i> appear also in some cases
to vary in a manner very suggestive of phytophagic influences.
The observations upon <i>S. Ocellatus</i> recorded in the previous
<a href="#Footnote_100">note</a> (p. <a href="#Page_241">241</a>) may perhaps be interpreted in this sense. In
order to get experimental evidence upon this subject, I may
add that Mr. E. Boscher was good enough at my request to
repeat his observations, and conduct some breeding experiments
during the present year (1880). In the same locality as that
previously mentioned, seven larvæ were found feeding on <i>Salix
viminalis</i>, all of which were the bright green spotted variety;
and in the same osier-bed six more were found on another
species of <i>Salix</i>, two of these being the bluish-green variety,
and the other four the bright green form. Unless we have
here a local race, these observations, in connection with those of
last year, tend to show that the light green form is associated
with <i>Salix viminalis</i>. When found in the natural state feeding
on apple, the caterpillar of this species is generally, perhaps
invariably, the bluish-green form. In order to try the effect of
breeding the larvæ <i>ab ovo</i> on distinct food-plants, a large number
of eggs laid by a female <i>Ocellatus</i> in July were divided into
three batches, one being supplied with <i>Salix triandra</i>, another
with <i>S. viminalis</i>, and the third lot with apple. The experiment
unfortunately failed in great part, owing to most of the
larvæ dying off, three from the third lot only surviving; but
these were all of the bluish-green form, which colour was
shown by all the caterpillars of this batch from their earliest
stage. The observation is thus so far successful, as it goes
to support the view that the variety mentioned is associated
with apple (and <i>S. triandra?</i>) My friend Mr. W. J. Argent
informs me that he had a number of specimens of <i>Sphinx
Ligustri</i> in his possession this autumn, some of which had been
found on lilac and others on laurestinus, and he states that all
those on the latter plant had the ground-colour distinctly darker
than in those feeding on lilac. I learn also from Mr. W. Davis,
of Dartford, that he found a number of these larvæ this year
feeding on ash, and that they were all differently coloured to
those found on lilac or privet, being of a more greyish-green.
Another case of colour-variation in larvæ is that <i>Emmelesia
Unifasciata</i>, specimens of which I have recently had an opportunity
of examining, through the courtesy of Mr. W. Davis.
This species feeds on the seeds of a species of <i>Bartsia</i> when
the capsules are in various stages of growth, and (omitting
details of marking) those caterpillars found on the green capsules
were green, whilst those on the brown capsules were of a
corresponding colour.
</p>
<p>
On the whole I am inclined to believe that sufficient importance
has not hitherto been given to phytophagic variability as
a factor in determining larval coloration, and a large field
for experimental investigation here lies open for future work.
The obscure chemico-physiological processes which may
perhaps be shown by such researches to lead to phytophagic
variation, cannot, I am persuaded, produce any great divergence
of character if unaided; but when such causes of variability play
into the hands of natural selection variations of direct <i>protective
advantage</i> to the species, we can easily see that this all-important
agency would seize upon and perpetuate such a
power of adaptability to a variable environment. (See Proc.
Zoo. Soc. 1873, p. 158, and “Nature,” vol. xiv., pp. 329 and
330.) R.M.]</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_141" id="Footnote_141" href="#FNanchor_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> [In 1879 Mr. George Francis, of Adelaide, forwarded from
the latter place a number of moths (a species of Anapæa)
together with their larvæ (in alcohol) and cocoons (Proc. Ent.
Soc. 1879, p. xvi), and in an accompanying note he stated that
the male larva when living is of “a bright emerald green, with
red and pink markings on the back, and yellow, black, and
white streaks on the sides.” The male larva is described as
being smaller than the female, and as possessing all the
brilliant colours, the latter “having no red markings, but only
white, yellow, and green, with a little black.” I was at first
disposed to think that we might be dealing here with two distinct
species having differently marked larvæ; but Mr. Francis
this present year (1880) forwarded a large number of the living
cocoons of this species, which I separated according to size,
and, on the emergence of the moths (August), I found that all
those from the small cocoons were males, and those from the
larger cocoons females. There can be no doubt, therefore,
that we have but one species in this case, the larva of which
presents the remarkable phenomenon of sexual difference of
coloration. As an analogous fact I may here mention the
well-known case of <i>Orgyia Antiqua</i>, the larva of which differs
in the colour of the tufts of hair according to sex. R.M.]</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_142" id="Footnote_142" href="#FNanchor_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> [I have already given reasons for suspecting that the colour
of green caterpillars may be due to the presence of chlorophyll
(or some derivative thereof) in their tissues (see Proc. Zoo.
Soc. 1873, p. 159). This substance appears to be one of great
chemical stability, and, according to Chautard, who has detected
it in an unaltered state in the tissues of certain leaf-feeding
insects by means of its absorption spectrum (“Comp. Rend.”
Jan. 13th, 1873), it resists the animal digestive processes
(Ann. Ch. Phys. [5], iii., 1&ndash;56). If this view should be
established by future observations, we must regard the green
colour of caterpillars as having been produced, when protective,
from phytophagic variability by the action of natural selection;
and the absence of colour in internal feeders, above referred to,
is only secondarily due to the exclusion of light, and depends
primarily on the absence of chlorophyll in their food. In connection
with this I may adduce the fact, that some few species
of <i>Nepticula</i> (<i>N. Oxyacanthella</i>, <i>N. Viscerella</i>, &amp;c.) are green,
although they live in leaf-galleries where this colour can hardly
be of use as a protection; but their food (hawthorn and elm)
contains chlorophyll. See also note <a href="#Footnote_130">130</a>, p. <a href="#Page_293">293</a>. Further investigations

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_144" id="Footnote_144" href="#FNanchor_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> The geographical distribution of the dark form indicates
that in the case of this species also, the form referred to is
replacing the yellow (green) variety. Whilst in the middle of
Europe (Germany, France, Hungary) the dark form is extremely
rare, in the south of Spain this variety, as I learn from Dr. Noll,
is almost as common as the yellow one. I hear also from
Dr. Staudinger that in South Africa (Port Natal) the dark form
is somewhat the commoner, although the golden-yellow and,
more rarely, the green varieties, occur there. I have seen a
caterpillar and several moths from Port Natal, and these all
agree exactly with ours. The displacement of the green (yellow)
form by the dark soil-adapted variety, appears therefore to
proceed more rapidly in a warm than in a temperate climate.
[Eng. ed. Dr. Noll writes to me from Frankfort that the
caterpillar of <i>Acherontia Atropos</i> in the south of Spain does
not, as with us, conceal itself by day in the earth, but on the
stems underneath the leaves. “At Cadiz, on the hot, sandy
shore, <i>Solanum violaceum</i> grows to a height of three feet, and
on a single plant I often found more than a dozen <i>Atropos</i>
larvæ resting with the head retracted. It can easily be understood
why the lateral stripes are blue when one has seen the
south European <i>Solaneæ</i>, on which this larva is at home.
<i>Solanum violaceum</i> is scarcely green: violet tints alternate with
brown, green, and yellow over the whole plant, and between
these appear the yellow-anthered flowers, and golden-yellow
berries of the size of a greengage. Thus it happens that the
numerous thorns, an inch long, between which the caterpillar
rests on the stem, pass from violet into shades of blue, red,
green, and yellow.”]</p></div>

such an obvious means of producing a stripe in cases where it
would have been advantageous? In answer to this I may
state, that in large numbers of species the dorsal line has thus
become utilized; but in the case of large caterpillars resting
among foliage, it can be easily seen that light lateral (<i>i.e.</i> subdorsal)
stripes, are more effective in breaking the homogeneity
of the body than a dorsal line only slightly darker than the
general ground-colour. Lateral lines are in fact visible from
<i>two directions of space</i>. If a caterpillar thus marked be placed
on a twig, these lines are visible when we look at the creature’s
back or at either side. That the subdorsal are therefore the

to conceive that even a secondary larval form may have been

fact that in a majority of instances it is possible to trace an
intimate connection between the surroundings of a larva and
its organization proves in the clearest way <i>that the characters
of the majority of existing larval forms of insects have owed their
origin to secondary adaptations</i>. A few instances will illustrate
this point:&mdash;In the simplest types of metamorphosis, <i>e.g.</i> those
of the Orthoptera genuina, the larva has precisely the same
habits as the adult. We find that a caterpillar form is assumed
by phytophagous larvæ amongst the Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera,
and Coleoptera. Where the larva has not to go in search
of its nutriment the grub-like apodous form is assumed. The
existence of such an apodous larva is especially striking in
the Hymenoptera, in that rudiments of thoracic and abdominal
appendages are present in the embryo and disappear again in
the larva.... It follows from the above that the development
of such forms as the Orthoptera genuina is more primitive
than that of the holometabolous forms, &amp;c.” Comparative

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_247" id="Footnote_247" href="#FNanchor_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> [Eng. ed. It has frequently been objected to me that the
existing Axolotl is not a form resulting from atavism, but a case
of “arrested growth.” The expression “atavism” is certainly to
be here taken in a somewhat different sense than, for example, in
the case of the reversion of the existing Axolotl to the Amblystoma
form. Further on, I have myself insisted that in the first
case the phyletic stage in which the reversion occurred is still
completely preserved in the ontogeny of each individual, whilst
the Amblystoma stage has become lost in the ontogeny of the
Axolotl. If, therefore, we apply the term “atavism” only to
such characters or stages (<i>i.e.</i> complexes of characters) as are
no longer preserved in the ontogeny, we cannot thus designate
the present arrest of the Axolotl at the perennibranchiate stage.
Such a restriction of the word, however, appears to me but
little desirable, since the process is identical in both cases, <i>i.e.</i>
it depends upon the same law of heredity, in accordance with
which a condition formerly occurring as a phyletic stage
suddenly reappears through purely internal processes. It is
true that the reversion is not <i>complete</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the present
sexually mature Axolotl does not correspond in all details
with its perennibranchiate ancestors. Since Wiedersheim has
shown that the existing Axolotl possesses an intermaxillary
gland, this can be safely asserted. This gland occurs only in
<i>land</i> Amphibians, and therefore originated with the Amblystoma
form, afterwards becoming transferred secondarily to
the larval stage. Nevertheless, the present Axolotl must
resemble its perennibranchiate ancestors in most other characters,
and we should be the more entitled to speak of a reversion
to the perennibranchiate stage as we speak also of the
reversion of single characters. To this must be added that
the Axolotl does not correspond exactly with an Amblystoma
larva, since Wiedersheim has shown that the space for the
intermaxillary gland is present, but that the gland itself is
confined to a few tubes which do not by any means fill up
this space. (“Das Kopfskelet der Urodelen.” Morph. Jahrbuch,
vol. iii. p. 149). By the expression “arrested growth”
not much is said, if at the same time the cause of the arrest
is left unstated. But what can be the cause why the whole
organization remains stationary at the perennibranchiate stage,
the sexual organs only undergoing further development?
Surely only that law or force of heredity known by its effects,
but obscure with respect to its causes, through which old
phyletic stages sometimes suddenly reappear, or in other words,
that power through which reversion takes place. It must not
be forgotten that all these cases of “larval reproduction” in
Amphibians appear suddenly. The present sexually mature
form of the Axolotl has not arisen by the sexual maturity gradually
receding in the ontogeny from generation to generation,
but by the occurrence of single individuals which were sexually
mature in the perennibranchiate stage, these having the advantage
over the <i>Amblystomæ</i> in the struggle for existence under
changed climatic conditions.
</p>
<p>
By admitting a reversion, we perfectly well explain why arrest
at the perennibranchiate stage can be associated with complete
development of the sexual organs; the assumption of an
“arrested growth” leaves this combination of characters completely
unexplained. Moreover, I am of opinion that the
expressions “arrested growth” or “reversion” are of but
little importance so long as the matter itself is clear.]</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_256" id="Footnote_256" href="#FNanchor_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> [Eng. ed. It was mentioned in the German edition of
this work that in the spring of 1876 a female Amblystoma of
the Jardin des Plantes in Paris had laid eggs (see Blanchard in
the Compt. Rend. 1876, No. 13, p. 716). Whether these eggs
were fertile, or whether they developed was not then made known.
Thus much was however at the time clear, that even if this
had been the case, the reproduction of this Amblystoma would
have been only an <i>exceptional</i> occurrence. At that time there
were in the Jardin des Plantes Amblystomas which had been
kept for more than ten years, and only on one occasion was
there a deposition of eggs, and this by only one specimen.
That I was correct in speaking of the “sterility” of these
Amblystomas in spite of this one exception, is proved by the
latest communication from the Jardin des Plantes. We learn
from this (Compt. Rend. No. 14, July, 1879, p. 108) that in
the years 1877 and 1878 none of the Amblystomas laid any
more eggs, although all means were exerted to bring about
propagation. In April, 1879, eggs were again laid by one
female, and by a second in May. These eggs certainly developed,
as did those of 1876, and produced tadpoles. These
Amblystomas are therefore not absolutely, but indeed relatively
sterile. Whilst the Axolotl propagates regularly and freely every
year, this occurs with the Amblystoma but rarely and sparsely.
The degree of their sterility can only be approximately established
when we know the number of Amblystomas that have
since been kept in the Jardin des Plantes. Unfortunately
nothing has been said with respect to this.]</p></div>

the peloric (symmetrical) flowers which occasionally appear as
atavistic forms in <i>Corydalis solida</i> are partly sterile and partly
fertile. That in other causes of sterility, and above all by
bastardizing, the reproductive power is lost in the most varying
degrees, has been known since the celebrated observations of
Kölreuter and Gärtner. [Eng. ed. An Orchid (<i>Catasetum

(<i>Myanthus barbatus</i>) differ considerably from the female

430) with reference to the Axolotl of Lake Como in the Rocky
Mountains, which he states always becomes transformed into
<i>Amblystoma Mavortium</i>, that this metamorphosis “takes place
in the water, and the Amblystomas, so long as they are little,
actually live exclusively in the water, as I know by my own
experience. A young Amblystoma which I kept alive for a
long time, never went out of the water of its own free will,
while one nearly twice as large lives entirely on land and only
takes a bath now and then. It always goes into the water when
the temperature of the air in the cellar, in which my aquaria
stand, falls below that of the water&mdash;down to about 6° or 8° C.”
This statement appears to suggest that the effect of temperature
may be a factor in some way concerned in these interesting
cases of transformation, and would in any case be well
worthy of experimental investigation. Some further details
concerning the <i>Siredon Lichenoides</i> of Lake Como have been
recently published by Mr. W. E. Carlin (Proc. U.S. National
Museum, June, 1881). The lake, which is shallow, is fed by
a constant stream of fresh water, but the water of the lake is
intensely saline. The Siredon never enter the fresh water
stream, but congregate in large numbers in the alkaline waters
of the lake. “When about one hundred and fifty were placed
in fresh water they seemed to suffer no inconvenience, but it
had a remarkable effect in hastening their metamorphosis into
the Amblystoma form. Of an equal number kept in fresh
water and in the lake water, quite a change occurred with the
former after twenty-four hours, while the latter showed no
change after several days of captivity. Those that were kept
well fed in jars usually began to show a slight change in from
two to three weeks, and all of them completed the change into
the Amblystoma inside of six weeks, while in some kept, but
not specially fed, there were but three changes in three
months.” (Nature, Aug. 25th, 1881, p. 388.) R.M.]</p></div>

not investigate Nature’s processes, and not only correlate these,

indeed both desirable and necessary if natural knowledge is

becomes a philosopher, and the vitality of the so-called

for having clothed my ideas upon the theory of selection in the
form of a reply to Von Hartmann. I willingly admit that this
author cannot be considered as the leader of existing philosophical

Frederick Albert Lange has certainly a much greater claim to
this position. Lange does not however combat this theory;
he accepts and develops it most beautifully and lucidly on a
sound philosophical basis in such a manner as has never been
done before from this point of view (“Geschichte des Materialismus,”
3rd. ed., 1877, vol. ii. pp. 253&ndash;277). On most
points I can but agree with Lange. Von Hartmann, however,
whose objections appeared to me to be supported by a wide
scientific knowledge, afforded me a suitable opportunity of
developing my own ideas upon some essential points in the
theory of selection. In this sense only have I attempted to
interfere with this author, the refutation of his views, as such,
having been with me a secondary consideration.] [The chief
exponent of the doctrine of organic evolution in this country
